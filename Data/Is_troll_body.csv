1,"Without doing my due diligence and not being familiar with this card and $CTR this all raises one question for me:

To whom did the XRP go? If sent to CTR this doesn't seem to be at all what XRP is expected to be or look like, but just a trusted third party acting as immediate brokerage. And was this XRP change logged on the ledgers at this moment or is it essentially the two-payment-paradox but now done with extra steps because Ripple?

1,"Have recently decided to invest in the Mining Now project http://miningnow.online/. Bought several tokens for 9 euros each, now I'm waiting for the first payments. I can defend my investment by the fact that AA! LAB, that runs this project, is very concerned bout its reputation and has given me the opportunity to make a token purchase with a bank card, which means that theres a legal entity. Also, if something goes wrong, I can profitably sell them on stock exchanges."

1,"At home have a cheap mining farm. I earn a little on mining and I would like more. I decided to look for another pool, hoping to raise my earnings, and found an offerin this opportunity one, from AA! LAB (http://miningnow.online/). Gave the farm under the management of the company two weeks ago, but I'm already happy with the organization of the mining process. There`s a pretty cool program that helps to mine profitable cryptocurrency, and selects it automatically. And what`s ur opinion on mining in pools?"

1,"My parents tell me about this time when I was a toddler and they took me to the fair one day. Apparently I somehow managed to wander off out of their sight, leaving my parents to freak out and panic while searching everywhere for me. My hair was bleach blonde and my Mom saw me from afar holding the hand of some random old man she didn't know. She screamed for my Dad who then ran and scooped me up from the old man. I'm not sure what if his intentions were good or bad but it still makes me wonder what would have happened if my parents didn't find me."

1,"My extremely close, fun, trusting, platonic friendship with my sister is largely the result of the lust I once felt for her.

I'm a couple of years older than my sister, but we started puberty at about the same time. I had felt sexual attraction to girls since I was a small child, I'm guessing that my natural inhibitions are just lower than the norm. Anyway, when she started developing her body I was attracted to it. Very.

We were comfortable with each other (we soon got along better with each other than any of our other siblings) and she had the innocence of the 10-year-old she was, so I ended up seeing stuff every once in a while. Nip slips, changing with the door open, etc. I was so ashamed and scared, but also desperately pubescently horny. So, I naturally went about things the same way stupid boys do with girls: I treated her like a princess.

Now, she was a bit of a brat growing up, and we treated her like it, so she must have noticed when I started treating her differently. As far as I could (and can) tell, she was appreciative that at least one person in the family enjoyed spending time with her. Wrestling on the couch. Playing video games together. Going to the local pool. I was damn distracted, but still enjoying my time with her. Trying desperately not to be caught in my sneaking glances or be too obvious with my physicality.

It was torturous. The cognitive dissonance between caring about her and what's appropriate in general, and desperately wanting her body, was one of the biggest struggles of my childhood. I remember one night on vacation we slept in the same bed in a hotel room. I stayed up the whole night, all too aware of her beside me. How thin her pajamas were, how easy it would be to stick out my hand and explore, wondering if it would wake her up.

Fortunately, I won this struggle. Nothing happened that night. Shortly afterward, I decided that I needed to get my life back in order (as a thirteen year old, I already felt like my life was a mess) and decided to completely repress any urges or thoughts related to her whatsoever. It took months, and my shame didn't go away for a long time. I honestly have no idea where I got the massive resolve needed.

Now, we're very close, and I never think or feel about her sexually. I suppose on a subconscious level I still know that her body is attractive, but I don't regard it as a prospect any more. We're closer than any of our other family members, to the point that we think almost exactly the same thoughts at the same time (even though our personalities are different in plenty of ways) and have tons of inside jokes. We have so much fun together, and I honestly believe that it was largely caused by my childhood maneuverings.

Nowadays, I'm almost exclusively attracted to women of other ethnicity (my first few girlfriends probably had a lot to do with that), which I'm convinced helps; however, as an adult, I've discovered with a bit of fear and disgust that I also have somewhat of an attraction to girls the age she was when this started (9+, barely starting puberty). It's not as strong as attraction to women my age, however, and I'm not worried at all. I talked to a therapist a bit about that part just to be sure that all is well; despite some weird challenges along the way, all certainly is well. I've honestly never spoken of this as far as I can remember, and I had the urge to get it off my chest just recently, so thank you all for listening.

A lot of people think lawyers are immoral when they defend corporations, but I disagree. (1) Regardless of who's right, it's simply not a fair trial if the party being sued for millions of dollars is denied access to legal advice and representation. (2) Companies are in the right more often than you'd think. We get a lot of ridiculous lawsuits from individuals obviously after the company's deep pockets. (3) Many lawsuits boil down to simple misunderstandings between companies about contract terms, and 9x out of 10 we end up settling out of court once the parties come to an agreement.

tl;dr: I sleep well at night.

1,"FOIA request filed for photographs and/or documents related to a vandalism incident on the CSU Sacramento campus came back with no responsive documents.

This incident is mentioned here. Taken from (https://www.coldcase-earons.com/27.php)

11-7-77: 5:40 p.m.
LE received a call from Sergeant Ortiz of the California State Campus Police regarding a note written on the bathroom wall in a campus restroom. The note, according to Ortiz, concerned information about the East Area Rapist. At 6:10 p.m., LE met with Ortiz in the library at the University. The men's room located on the main floor of the building, in the middle stall on the right hand side, written in pencil, was a message which stated, ""The East Side Rapist was here / Will rape my first black girl tonight / Dumb cops will never find me."" They photographed the message.

I still believe that the release of documents related Tom EARs is possible via FOIA requests. It would be interesting if someone has a list of all EARS related FOIA requests ever filed. I would think something like a request for only specific documents (even if only tangentially related to the case) could succeed in getting additional documents released. "

1,"Spider-Man not only because he's relatable, but because he's full of interesting dichotomies that people often overlook. He's one of the only superheroes with dual classic origins. It was common during the Gold and Silver Ages for characters to be bestowed with powers via some outside accident (Flash/Hulk) or to become exceptional through their own brilliance and ingenuity (Batman/Iron Man). Both of these play an important part in Spider-Man's origin. He gets bitten by the radioactive spider, but without his brilliance in science, he couldn't create the webshooters, an iconic and essential part of his power set. As originally conceived, he's just as responsible for becoming Spider-Man as the accident is. The organic webshooters from the Raimi films completely eliminates this unique aspect of the character and his origins.

He's a nerd and he's not. Most people with only peripheral familiarity with the character think he's always the stereotypical nerd (glasses/always picked on etc) but, although he starts out this way, the character quickly evolves out of this phase (as one realistically would after gaining exceptional powers). The most recognizable version (to comic fans) comes from an era in which the character is social and juggles romantic interests (Gwen Stacy, Mary Jane, Felicia Hardy...) and his failures in these areas stem from his crime-fighting responsibilities getting in the way of his normal life not because he's the perpetual nerd.

The tragedy of his origin also makes for one of the most justifiable reasons to do what he does. Like Batman, Spider-Man puts on the mask because of the murder of a loved one, but unlike Batman, he is partially responsible for the events leading to Ben's death. Bruce Wayne starts on his path after his parents' death, but there was nothing he could do to prevent it. Peter had all the power and opportunity to prevent his Uncle's death but refused to stop a criminal out of selfishness. It's this guilt that drives him not just the tragedy.

Spider-Man is not relatable because he's an everyman. Between his powers and his intellect, he's anything but. What's interesting about the character is that he's so relatable despite not being an everyman.

For example if people ordered Long Island, some rare whiskey and so on and your order is beer or simple shot of bourbon there is a very high possibility that I'll pour it first 'cause I don't want you to wait 15 minutes for that. 

But that is not a common thing. In some places bartenders prepare drinks strictly in the order that was made by orders. That happens in large bars usually because it's hard to remember everything when you distract yourself. So in this kind of places the best way to get your drink is to wait calmly. If I'm in the middle of something with bazillion of drinks in my mind and you're shouting or trying to tip beforehand - well, it's not about my anger or something like that, I'll make it slower only because you fucked with my memory and I lost the momentum.

1,"Dad of a 7 year-old girl here.

There are times when parenting a child is like watching magic grow right before your eyes. Watching them have fun, or learn something new, or that glimmer of understanding of a fundamental truth of life is unlike anything you'll ever experience in any other walk of life. It's truly a blessing.

There are ALSO times when having a child is like being related to one of the biggest assholes on the face of the planet.

They don't tell you that part when you're going to Lamaze classes.

1,"Crazy long story so I'll try to summarize it.

I read a few sections of Craigslist nearly daily and read about a dog that was lost and the owner was pleading with everyone everyday to keep an eye out for her beloved doggy and updating with sightings and the sort. This went on for maybe two weeks. You could tell she loved the dog and was really heartbroken; I felt awful for her.

Then it seems the dog is found / rescued but the ""finders"" refuse to return the dog to the owner. This just kills the owner and she doesn't know where the dog is being kept / where these people live...etc. She continues to post about it on Craigslist begging these people to return her dog.

Well its December 3rd, 2008 and I'm at work. Suddenly someone yells fire and yep, it's my jeep She's on fire. Burns to the ground. Awful, awful day. I have the Mr. pick me up at work and instead of going home we head right to the bar so I can grieve properly. We're drinking in the middle of the workday at this bar and there's hardly anyone else in there and we're making conversation with the bartender. I talked about shopping for a new jeep and Craigslist comes up. From here I mention this stranger's problem with the dog and how sad it is/I'd kill someone if they stole my dog/they must be crushed...etc. Well the bartender chimes in with, ""Is it a white husky? My neighbor at the apartment complex all of a sudden has this white husky that showed up out of thin air and to be honest my neighbors are kinda dicks so that sounds like something they'd do.""

I email the lost dog lady putting her in touch with bartender lady. They involve the police. Turns out it WAS her dog and the police got him back for her and they all lived happily ever after. YAY.

It's pure instinct, when cats are fighting for power in a house.

>One would have thought that it was even more necessary to limit population than property; and that the limit should be fixed by calculating the chances of mortality in the children, and of sterility in married persons. The neglect of this subject, which in existing states is so common, is a never-failing cause of poverty among the citizens; and poverty is the parent of revolution and crime.

1,"Living in your own filth isn't the kind of thing that is fixed by more education and more money for those programs. 

Empathy and 'less judgement' are nice slogans of the Myth of the Feel Good that stands in for actual thinking about these problems, and that's about all they are. There's no need to be 'empathetic' with a person living in their own filth to understand that something is very wrong. We've already crossed the line into judgement when we say ""hey, maybe you shouldn't be living in your own shit?""

These are things that any human being who isn't a complete fuck-up will understand. They aren't fuck-ups because people said mean things about them, and this isn't just because they are poor and 'not given chances'.

1,">If the value of 'religion' is what is in dispute -as above- (a subject reddit seems to be overly dismissive of) saying Science wouldn't exist without it is 'true' in a sense but almost entirely irrelevant to the worth of 'religion'. 

This is changing the subject, though, as the original point wasn't that 'religion is good because it led to the enlightenment and science', but to point out that as a matter of historical fact the rise of science grew out of the soil of the Christian worldview. No Christianity in Europe means you don't get the enlightenment or the scientific revolution, because the basic pieces just aren't in place.

The case for the value and the goodness of Christianity and Christian morality are entirely separate to this. "
1,It isn't a Nazi reference.
1,"Plato thought the world was rationally ordered by perfect forms that transcended material reality. Aristotle believed that nature was shot through with teleological causation. Nothing about either view is 'scientific' in any recognizable way. 

Both were heavy influences on the early Christianity of late antiquity and Aristotle, in particular, was a driving motivation behind the medieval scholasticism, which is really what you've been complaining about as 'stifling' the progress of science. 

The rationalistic and scientific tradition that grew out of the middle ages in the Renaissance and the early Enlightenment eras were thoroughly Christian and descended out of the ideas you mention because of their integration into Christian thought, not in spite of it. "
1,"Suppose you didn't have any plausible alternative account for the rationality of science or the development of its methodology independent of people showing up at Church events, you'd be pretty stupid to believe that it would 'just happen because progress' like Mr. Jetpack a few comments up

Somehow blind faith in (totally not religious) final causes is better than the counterfactual speculation you cleared your throat to remind everyone was a problem"
1,"> saying that I wouldn't exist without my parents getting to know each other at some nonsense church event

So you're saying that it's both true and pretty damn important to how things turned out, thanks for the support"
1,I don't identify as a Nazi. That's just your excuse for when you are intellectually dominated and unable to respond to facts. You've clearly had a lifetime to get used to that.
1,I love families. I hate the values of fatnerds who want to destroy families because they think the best thing in life is to be a pleasure-seeking narcissist  doped up on SSRIs and staring into an iPhone all day. 
1,"What do you know, a one-sided, un-nuanced, and very wrong view of history by a redditor who thinks calling someone a Nazi is an argument. That's novel.

Tell me where in Descartes, Newton, Hobbes, Rousseau, or Locke, or really any other Enlightenment figure besides Hume, you find any challenge to ""Christian thought"". You can't, because you haven't read these people, and because they don't say anything of the sort.  

There are copious challenges to certain aspects of the established social and political order, which involve challenges to certain aspects of prevailing doctrine, but this is not anything like saying ""atheism won, religion sux"". Vaping ratheism fumes isn't good for you bro."
1,"What I suggest is that all of *these* suggestions get the explanations backward. I am not suggesting that human RATIONALBOTS decide to pick and choose their ideology, and Christianity is just one freedom-stifling value system among many. 

What I am suggesting is that individual character, and individual desires and preferences, all stem from the culture that one is raised in and in which one learns to what is right and wrong. So yes, there would be longer and more stable marriages, there would be fewer illegitimate births, and there would be more civic pride and basic decency in a deeply Christian culture. The very idea of ""loveless marriages"" and kids that can't keep it in their pants supposes a culture that values individualism to a radical degree and thus Christian values inevitably conflict with that sort of freedom.

In an actual Christian culture liberal ideals of radically individualist freedom don't enter into the picture. Character, faith, and virtue would all be central to a person's identity, and the very idea of ""freedom"" being stomped upon would not enter into it."

>Your ignorance is astounding. We lost over 1000 years of scientific progress because the church stifled free thought,

""Lost"" 1000 years of progress aye, so who was doing science before the Church? Who created the conditions that allowed the beginnings of science in the first place? What were the theoretical origins of science if not in the theological philosophy of the time? 

You people really do think that one day a fatnerd guzzled his Mountain Dew, put on his fedora, and ugh vapid Xtians were slain by FREE REASON. This is proven by Jacobin radicalism! 

Reading what these people thought is very difficult I realize but try it sometime."
1,"""Challenged"" doesn't mean what you think. Descartes thought that God was the ultimate source of knowledge. Newton drew heavily on Descartes's mathematical and philosophical works to formulate his beliefs. Locke was a voluntarist Deist. Bacon's proto-science was also within the Christian tradition of the enlightenment. This isn't even a controversial interpretation, it's explicit in their writings. 

They challenged the entrenched Aristotelianism of the scholastics, but to say they were atheists or even making an attempt at atheism is just wrong. This is the quality of post on r/nz. "
1,Winston is right about this as usual.
1,"You wouldn't have had science in the first place if it weren't for the heritage of Christian thought and the worldview and social environment that allowed it to emerge and to thrive, partly by preserving lost ancient thought and partly by providing the foundations in thought for what would become science. Read any work by Bacon, Newton, Descartes, Locke, or anyone else involved in the beginnings of science. Their debt to Christianity is explicit.

Medieval scholasticism isn't the extent of religion and the reddit atheist myth is laughable."
1,"It must be mighty embarrassing to you lot to have the ""white supremacist"" turn out to be of better moral fibre time and time again, while you can't even bother to address an argument instead of attacking me."

1,"> John Key is a political grandmaster 

Let's be realistic here. Key is, at best, an awkward man who is uncomfortable talking off the cuff and has had fortunate windfalls. 

* He has money, and money can buy gold-class PR advice, which mean you don't have to think hard when the cameras are on. Just stick to the script and all is fine.

* The media here is even more powerless, staffed by spineless yes-men who are more interested in clicks than in reporting, and entirely uninterested in journalism than most other English-speaking nations. This makes it even easier to get away with scripted sound-bites when you know not one mainstream voice will question you, and even if they do, you can easily exploit the fickle ADD of the news cycle to ignore it because there will be no on-going investigations. 

* The population who votes, and who get their political news from this same media, also aren't bothered by how things are. Most of them benefit from it, whether you're an Auckland property investor or a dairy farmer. Everything is fine, or at least looks fine, for them. That rosy outlook means any problems they do encounter aren't due to them and the things they like (which means Key and his National government). No one gives away their golden egg, and there is no incentive to look to the effects of this way of thinking on future generations or the long-term stability of the nation as a whole. 

* The opposition is so embarrassingly weak and ineffectual that the popularity of an awkward banker who has to buy coaching and rely on having lucked into a crippled media and receptive voting demographic in order to have a semblance of popularity (which he still has to pay for), and in other times and places would be highly unpopular, continues to stump them. This is one part due to a constant need to define themselves as *against John Key* rather than pushing a strong positive vision, and one part because they have even less of a grasp of the media and how to generate favorable public sentiment than a stiff banker who had to buy his popularity. This leaves them both unable to generate any positive movement and wide open to Key's counters.

An actual grandmaster would wipe the floor with Key, much the way Trump has cleaned house in the US against people who are cut from the same milquetoast cardboard. Key is a big fish in small backwater, who has paid for big-ticket PR coaching and been fortunate enough to exploit it in a slew of favorable circumstances. If Labour wants to attack Key in a way that sticks, they need to get a better grip on what moves voters and how to leverage the media to make use of that knowledge."

1,"He's on record as having opposed the Iraq War, up to and including calling out GW Bush on stage with Jeb Bush and in front of the Republican establishment in South Carolina.

He's talking about making peace with Putin while literally every other candidate (this includes Hillary) is making chickenhawk noises about Syria.Trump is not a neocon, and he's going out of his way to make that wing of the US establishment his enemy.

>**1. Human sexuality is an objective biological binary trait: “XY” and “XX” are genetic markers of health – not genetic markers of a disorder.** The norm for human design is to be conceived either male or female. Human sexuality is binary by design with the obvious purpose being the reproduction and flourishing of our species. This principle is self-evident. The exceedingly rare disorders of sex development (DSDs), including but not limited to testicular feminization and congenital adrenal hyperplasia, are all medically identifiable deviations from the sexual binary norm, and are rightly recognized as disorders of human design. Individuals with DSDs do not constitute a third sex.


>**3. A person’s belief that he or she is something they are not is, at best, a sign of confused thinking.** When an otherwise healthy biological boy believes he is a girl, or an otherwise healthy biological girl believes she is a boy, an objective psychological problem exists that lies in the mind not the body, and it should be treated as such. These children suffer from gender dysphoria. Gender dysphoria (GD), formerly listed as Gender Identity Disorder (GID), is a recognized mental disorder in the most recent edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association (DSM-V).5 The psychodynamic and social learning theories of GD/GID have never been disproved.


>**8. Conditioning children into believing a lifetime of chemical and surgical impersonation of the opposite sex is normal and healthful is child abuse.** Endorsing gender discordance as normal via public education and legal policies will confuse children and parents, leading more children to present to “gender clinics” where they will be given puberty-blocking drugs. This, in turn, virtually ensures that they will “choose” a lifetime of carcinogenic and otherwise toxic cross-sex hormones, and likely consider unnecessary surgical mutilation of their healthy body parts as young adults."

If people are calling cats ""dogs"", and they are demonstrably ignorant of the history and use of the word ""cat"", they're just mistaken. You haven't changed the meaning of the concept.

Words acquire meaning in the use of language, but this is not the same as claiming that I can start using the word ""dog"" to refer to small four-legged animals that meow, which is what you're doing now by ignoring the vast body of political writings that has no part of defining ""the right"" as you're trying so hard to define it. 

You should actually get a passing mark in theory of language before giving sweeping and incorrect Reddit lectures about how words come to mean things.

This has only been the case since c.1970s stemming from ideological changes in the US and the UK. This is a recent invention, and if you're as read up as you're trying to make yourself look, you'd know this. 

You want to call National ""right"" when they're more progressive than most left-wing parties historically and throughout the world right now, fine, but it's a pointless platitude. ""Social conservatism"" and ""small government"" are nonsense in this usage since, as a party supporting for example gay marriage and the immense regulatory state we have in NZ, National does not even meet these criteria.

>Similarly, restrictions on labelling through the TPPA's sanitary and phytosanitary measures may restrict opportunities for our food exporters to build a high quality, differentiated market position.

>The TPPA will also protect the US and other heavy users of agricultural subsidies. This will hinder WTO efforts to reduce them.

>Overall, TPPA reads very much like a charter for incumbent businesses, dominated by US ones, which are attempting to hold back the tides of economic change the world needs.

The good news is that when your globalist scam collapses you traitors will be the first to starve."
1,">Left-wingers generally oppose the TPPA, especially the pro-big biz and fuck-everyone-else parts.

For this to be true requires a serious mangling of the left-right spectrum as it is ordinarily defined. In loosest terms the Left is revolutionary and progressive, they want to change and transform existing institutions. The Right wishes to preserve them. 

What passes for the left-right spectrum in recent NZ politics is closer to a doctrinal dispute among revolutionary progressives about what kind of radical change is for the best. The left-wingers you refer to want redistribution of wealth for what they take as the collective social good. 

The pseudo-right of the National Party wants to enact transformation by eroding the existing social and cultural institutions in favor of a politically borderless and economically homogenous global order centered on the interests of elites, mainly in the US and the UK. This is a very recent development, since the 1980s and 90s, and it coincides with the predominance of neoconservative policies in Western nations, which assimilated a revision of classical economic liberalism (""neoliberalism""). This is ""right-wing"" only in name, and it undermines the division into right and left to begin with. 

What I referred to by Economy Lefties are the globalists who want to sell out our nation (every nation) in order to get a piece of the pie that most of us will never see. Key and his government are big mediocre fish in a small pond, and no matter how much they betray us to foreign interests they will never be anything but con men selling us up the river so they can live in a mansion in Hawaii completely free of consequences."

1,">TPPA will likely reinforce our position as a commodity producer and hinder our progress up the value chain where greater economic prosperity lies.

I said exactly this in the other thread a few days ago, and was set upon by the howling Economy Lefties who think that hysteria is just overblown, because trade and wealth are great and sucking up to the US global order is the way to make that happen. 

There is no incentive to build this country into more than a giant farm and housing investment. The TPPA locks us into that form of serfdom when our concerns need to be building up our own. "

>it is by far the best treatment we've found for lowering suicide rates amongst people with gender dysphoria

Transsexuals commit suicide at roughly the same rates before and after transitioning, and in some studies at even higher rates after surgery. That suggests that the problem is not in being ""repressed"" or even bullied or otherwise mistreated. 

It's something going on in the person which needs to be addressed, not turned into a social crusade. 

>Preaching acceptance is not the same as trying to convert someone.

Preaching acceptance becomes conversion when children who may experience normal feelings of curiosity or confusion are told they are transsexuals and placed on chemical therapies.

Add to this the recent stigmatization of any speech that rejects these ideas, speech like mine, and you've got a recipe where anything is okay and any critic is no more than a worthless bigot to be shouted down and ignored.

That's not healthy for anyone, not least of which the free and open society the ""Left"" says it wants, and wishes to enforce at the point of a gun. "
1,"What do you take that is not right-wing in my statements? 

I do not think that transsexuals should be promoted as a healthy lifestyle, one that should be encouraged, and especially not one that children should be exposed to, let alone encouraged into. 

That said, I also think it is wrong to harm them or even to ostracize them as individuals. I am not heartless, I just disagree with the mediafication and glamorization of what I see as a harmful condition for all involved. That was the point of the comment you quoted, which was in defense of the transsexuals who were stoned to death by violent African migrants in Europe. "

Instead of having our own nation with its own culture, we're the South Pacific province of a global mediocrity. It's pathetic, and it's even more pathetic that so many so-called Kiwis have this mediocrity as their vision of the future."
1,"Key absolutely wants this. The man himself is a nervous wreck of a toadstool, but he's paid premium money for PR coaching and advice, and this is exactly the sort of move a real leader would make in an ongoing campaign to discredit his opponents.

Key knows the media jump at his command, and this is mainly because they're hindered by the Click Economy, so anything that gets eyeballs is going to get priority. Having raving rioters turn up and getting choice click-friendly edits in the TV news and the papers is a great way to boost the Key brand as the level-headed option. 

This is despite Key being a borderline Asperger's case who is not comfortable in public without a script and who has the charisma of a shy and insecure math geek.

You still haven't understood why the TPPA is a problem largely because it is symptomatic of a larger set of processes, and you can't or won't see that because of this blinkered way you insist on looking at matters. It's all neat categories.

It is exactly this problem, in the quoted bit about values and culture and community, that we have to face, and it's exactly that which you want to ""set aside"", as if that's a possibility. It isn't, not for you, not for anyone. These are not separable into the neat categories you need it to analyze into. "

1,"You need to look into policy laundering and the wider international context in which these trade agreements are being negotiated and applied. 

There is a reason all of these agreements are being applied as they are, in a manner that transcends national sovereignty and local jurisdictions. For starters they bypass the already flimsy ""democratic"" legitimacy that the governments of Western nations like to pretend that they have. This is not an accident. This way of enacting policy is done on purpose by the global elites as a way to enforce homogeneity through ""soft"" measures. "
1,"What exports mate? You have to build a nation and build businesses in order to have exports. 

We aren't getting that with the TPPA, which is just part of the on-going project to turn the place into a foreigner's paradise with housing and tourism. "

1,"I'm worried about a national identity and a home for the people who live here. TPPA supporters are worried about specific clauses within a sprawling bureaucratic nightmare. 

The priorities of TPPA supporters are clearly very different, and in a way that as entirely unsurprising as it is unappealing and ultimately destructive. 

Rootless cosmopolitans always think in these terms because they have no communities, families, or values to defend. "
1,"So we only missed out only the main reason we got into this treaty in in four of the five participating countries that aren't us.

1,"I'm citing Putnam as well as the whole range of literature showing the negative correlation between general trust and social capital, and ethnic diversity. 

Sturgis is an interesting case because he acknowledges that there is a negative effect on trust and cohesion, but in good apparatchik fashion he is also far more interested in explaining this relative to control for economic factors. This is tantamount to saying that once you control for massive skull trauma, getting shot in the head isn't positively correlated with injury. 

It's also ignoring the bare evidence that human beings prefer their own, aren't suited to mass society and the erosion of social bonds that it brings, and generally do not like being forced to be around people who aren't part of their local community. "
1,"You can make whatever judgements you want but it's a fact that diversity decreases trust and social cohesion. People trust people who share their culture, values, and language, and this is a fact about human social life. Preferring your own and wanting to take care of your own has become a problem through the efforts of those who have no roots and no stake in their community. 

Diversity erodes community trust and community bonds, and chanting the ""racist"" mantra is not going to call in special ideological magic to change those facts. "

If you can't walk into a shop in your own country and interact with the people running it because they haven't and likely won't learn the language, that's a problem that affects your community, erodes trust, and contributes however slightly to hostility. 

A city that is made up of enclaves of foreigners with their own language and culture is an unattractive place to live as it is inevitably a colder, less trusting environment. "

Mai Chen sure has integrated well, as evidenced by her stock globalist boilerplate that amounts to screwing the people that already live here so we can bring in more foreign values and foreign money.

These editorials never advocate for building up the country and making something for the actual citizens who live here.

Globalism, taxation, and gifting the landed classes aren't ""right wing"" policies. Cronyism isn't endemic to any political ideology.

1,"It's good choice for you. V9e and 65S are low-kick sticks. But V9e is top one. Despite of this, V9e is not true OPS. It's fused OPS like your 65S. I think it's not so good because true OPS sticks have better balance as usual. Moreover, V9e is heavy a bit. And I can say it is very soft stick  that creates more force with the same load. 
If you like your 65S, I think v9e is good for you. 
"
1,"To all appearances Bauer ranks first, Easton ranks second. CCM, Reebok, etc. are outsiders

It doesn't mean that CCM is bad, it is just not so popular"
1,"Graf has great history! Graf skates are very comfortable, but many players think they are too heavy"
1,it's just a consequence of less weight
1,And jofa got taken over by reebok
1,"I think easton sticks have nice design. Mako is white, rs is black. That looks very cool! 
I used easton mako stick, but I can't say it's my favorite one. I would like when stick provides me with a much more enhanced feel for the puck. "
1,"CCM has ribcore, rbz and tacks
Easton has htx, v-series and mako
Gloves of all brands have three lines: anatomical, classic and tapered fit. So, bauer vapor gloves are like ccm cl, bauer supreme is like ccm 30k, bauer nexus is like ccm 4-roll
But all skates are different. Players are forced to choose skates that are comfortable for them. "
1,"It's classic fit gloves. It should be like warriors dynasty. 
"
1,"hmm.. rbk 20k shoulder pads are more heavy than ccm cl or bauer apx. So, rbk 20k is better for defenders, but ccm cl is better for forwards. It's very important issue in fact. The same is for pants, etc. "
1,"I agree. Every player should buy what is comfortable for him. But it is very important for skates, gloves, pants and so on. Stick is otherwise... bauer apx is like ccm ribkor, warrior dynasty is like bauer nexus. It is matter of preference. Advertising is very important thing in this issue. I think most players like bauer because it has the hugest ad campaign"
1,My first stick was jofa titan. It was really shit
1,"What gloves do you use? I love anatomical gloves. I have reebok 11k, but I fit covert dt1. They're really great! But I don't like bauer total one nxg gloves. Just because they're not comfortable for me. "
1,It seems to be great! But I can't understand why in Australia? US in Canada are too close to each other to fly to so far
1,"Oh boy, it's like he did it intentionally or something, stop fueling the fuss over minor issues"
1,"The thing is, EU per se is getting torn to pieces because of obvious internal conflicts, both political and economic. Check out data on the growing separatism and economic problems of PIGS countries. "
1,How about a good old tradition of Middle East interventions? No way US could drop it
1,"Like I said in a similar thread, it is well known ISIS wouldn't have gained such strength if US hadn't withdrawn troops from Iraq. Or, if go further back to the past, if US hadn't invaded Iraq at all. 
Apparently, the ISIS issue will be up for the next President to solve. Obama's useless here. "
1,"I guess people are mad at the absence of such strategy. It is well known ISIS wouldn't have gained such strength if US hadn't withdrawn troops from Iraq. Or, if go further back to the past, if US hadn't invaded Iraq at all. "
1,"Tighten the grip? I know a guy from Russia, frankly he's not much into politics but according to him, common russkies like him don't feel any pressure at all. Sanctions are pretty much the last thing they care about. "
1,"From what I've dragged out of different financial breakdowns, the 2008-2009 financial crisis triggered by the mortgage thing in the US, hasn't actually finished yet. EU, US and even China are in the doldrums and judging by the scale of their internal problems, there is no easy way out of it at all. "
1,Is US going to send arms to Taliban to nail ISIS? Cause that sounds very much like something in the vein of recent US foreign policies
1,"Yeah, people here seem to be pretty 'unbiased' towards commies"
1,Learn to differentiate between volunteers who may feel free to take selfies and do whatever they want and regular army which will never be allowed to do something like this. 
1,Are you Russian? Cause you do sound aggressive
1,"Great, we've got to choose between Clintons and Bushes. Just wonder is it ever going to be about choosing the decent president instead of picking some sort of a representative of some oligarchic clan. "
1,"Yep, was kind of hinting at Obama as well. "
1,"Nah, not gonna buy it. All the airstrikes carried out by the US-led coalition eventually turn out to be ineffective. They even claimed to kill al-Baghdadi who surely ended up alive and kicking. "
1,It's Rudolf
1,"Just as planned: ISIS keeps advancing, West keeps pretending nothing happens"
1,"Well, considering many Syrian rebels later switched to ISIS...shouldn't we be seeking life sentence for Erdogan?"

1,Those 'whining companies' could also adopt altcoins.
1,"SegWit is already activated by the miners. For SegWit to have an effect, more addresses need to support it (wallets) as well, since the nodes will only use SegWit if the address sends the transaction using it. Right now only 10% of transactions are SegWit, which is why block size has been creeping above 1MB over the fall. It seems to have gotten stuck, though, because too many addresses still haven’t upgraded.

Lightning will be hugely important. We need it soon, and we need a new generation of walkers that (1) support SegWit and (2) do a better job of selecting the right fee level for the transaction.

For years the network was lightly loaded and many wallets (including the on-line wallet services like Coinbase) used a naive approach to transactions and didn’t optimize the fee offer for the transaction type: some transactions don’t need to be in the next 2 blocks (I can wait a day, if I’m sending money to London, so I don’t need to offer much of a fee), but the wallets I’ve used don’t offer me an interface for fee negotiation/estimation.

I’m not an expert, however. If you are, and I’ve made an error here, please point it out. I’m not embarrassed by being wrong as long as I learn something from it ;-)"

1,"I would have to go back and research it a little bit, but I believe that the photographs were initially released to someone who was writing a book about unidentified people. 

Page 5 from this collection of documents had a written release form mentioning a book being written with a tentative title of ""Who Am I: Real Life Cases of the Unidentified"". This looks to have been around 2001 (which is pre-NamUs):

https://www.scribd.com/document/264638650/Lyle-Stevik-1

I think that the photos were released (probably by FOIA) to someone working on a book. The book looks like it never materialized, but the photographs ended up on the internet. 

I wonder if the Gray's Harbor Sheriff's Department was happy about that (the sheer number of photographs that ended up online) considering that these photographs have helped fuel years of speculation and undoubtedly countless emails and phone calls to their department. "
1,"Feel free to glance at my Twitter if you are interested: https://twitter.com/robbydelaware?lang=en

My Twitter is overwhelmingly boring. I did mention the #ColumbianChemicals hashtag once or twice, which is what I think resulted in my inclusion on the list. Nothing I ever tweeted was overly offensive or even that notable (in my opinion). "
1,"Thank you for mentioning this in the AMA. At the very least, I would guess that the inclusion of my Twitter account in the research data would skew results. This is especially aggravating considering I posted an early warning message about a hoax launched on the morning of 9/11 2014: https://pastebin.com/zgbVtEMW

If any one is interested, there are around 100 or so other likely Internet Research Agency accounts listed in the document. 

I would guess that my sharing of a problematic hashtag (which was in a Tweet directed at a Federal agency encouraging them to investigate it) along with my overseas location and a couple of tweets poking fun at Sergei Lavrov in Cyrillic were enough to get me on a computer generated list. 

This is all very aggravating considering I live in a former Soviet state long bullied by the Russian Federation, and I am dedicated to transparency and democratic values. "
1,"Hi Ben, I was an American citizen who was accidentally included on the list of suspect accounts that was submitted by Twitter to Congress. Twitter has subsequently reinstated my account, thereby acknowledging the fact that I am not linked to the Internet Research Agency:

https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/8x5mma/twitter-told-congress-this-random-american-is-a-russian-propaganda-troll

I am hoping that my name can be scrubbed from the list of suspect accounts, as I believe that this will corrupt studies into Russian interference. If at all possible, could you please remove my account from the list included in your data set?"

Curiously enough, his NAMUS profile previously had more information, that was subsequently removed at some point. He had a receipt (or advertisement) from an electronic store in Lübbecke, Germany. He also had “geographical magazines from out of the country” among his possessions. 

Sounds as if someone came across the remains and stole wallet. You would think that a missing German would have been quickly identified - very curious case.

1,"I agree with you that it has been quiet lately. My two cents about it: I was a long time resident of Seattle, and I find it interesting that there has been virtually zero coverage of the case in the Seattle media.

I find it interesting that the Seattle Times [did such a good thing] (http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/special-reports/my-god-thats-kimberly-online-sleuth-solves-perplexing-mystery-of-identity-thief-lori-ruff/)with their coverage of the Lori Ruff story. Yet, virtually no media outlets in the Puget Sound have covered the Stevik story.

Considering how much people have obsessed over the case, you'd think that there would be interest in additional coverage in the case from the Seattle media. 

I think that perhaps now would be the appropriate time to consider ways to coordinate attempting to get this case additional coverage. 

I would like to think that Seattle's excellent [KUOW](http://kuow.org/contact-us) or the Seattle Times itself could be options.

If there were a change in the status of the case, perhaps law enforcement in Gray's Harbor would be willing to discuss this update.

Also, on an unrelated topic, someone mentioned that they thought that police reports from the Best Western Ramada in Meridian, Idaho were released. That's the address in Idaho that Stevik used. I've never seen any documents released by authorities in Idaho - has anyone seen these things?"
1,"No problem. Maybe we could put our heads together for other FOIA requests to file. Perhaps we could look into all police reports filed at the Best Western in Meridian, Idaho in the years 2000/2001."
1,"Seaside Lyle is only known person with the same name of Lyle Stevik. He is mentioned in the police report. He was questioned back in 2001, and was determined to not be Lyle. He lived (then, at least) in Seaside, Oregon.

There's been some speculation about him (perhaps he crossed paths with the John Doe, or stole his identity) before. 

EDIT: There's another Lyle Stevik on Facebook. This one is Italian. "

1,The FOIA request wasn't for photographs. It was only for email messages from the public to the email account associated with the investigation. They had already previously released Lyle's photographs (presumably with the full knowledge that they would be posted online). 
1,I was at Bumbershoot in either 2000 or 2001. I actually met David Cross at one of them. The event does draw a lot of people.
1,"Interesting to thinking about. According to Google Translator, there looks to be little difference between ""Stevik"" and ""Stevic"" - meaning that if ""Lyle Stevik"" was his actual name, and if he was an immigrant from Eastern Europe, he could have been using both spellings interchangeably. 

Here's ""Lyle Stevic"" in Macedonian: Лајл Стевиќ

Here's ""Lyle Stevik"" (with the ""k"") in Macedonian: Лајл Стевик

Notice the only difference is the accent character.

I've seen this (people using multiple spellings, especially if they aren't that familiar with Latin characters) happen before with Eastern Europeans - how many times have you been admonished by an airline to make sure that your ticket stub exactly matches what is printed on your passport?

Anyways, I ran some searches for ""Лајл Стевик"" and ""Лајл Стевиќ"" - which is ""Lyle Stevik"" and ""Lyle Stevic"" in the Macedonian language. No Google results were returned - as I don't believe ""Lyle"" in any iteration actually translates into Macedonian. 

I did, however, find a missing person case for one ""Slaviša Stević"" - which would also translate to ""Slavisa Stevick"".

Mentally disabled man who disappeared from Kosovo in 1999 - investigation was initially closed after it was reported he moved to Serbia. Case later reopened at the behest of the father:

http://www.unmikonline.org/hrap/Eng/Cases%20Eng/OP_50-09_ENG.pdf

He (along with 3 other ""Stevics/Steviks"") appeared in a news release from 2001 - all reported as being kidnapped. 

https://www.mail-archive.com/ctrl@listserv.aol.com/msg62170.html

Kind of interesting, but I doubt it is related to old Lyle. 

Begs the question, however. What harm would there be in having the Macedonian press writing up an article about this? All the info in the case is easy to find. If Macedonian press picks it up, perhaps in the off chance he's from that part of the world, maybe a family member will recognize..."
1,"I've heard about the Stevik case for some time now. I had thought I read it mentioned that in the immediate aftermath of the discovery of his body, someone suggested contacting the FBI. I filed a FOIA request for any files that the FBI might have on Stevik. A response was returned that there are no files. 

Perhaps we could put our heads together about any other FOIA requests that might be applicable to this case. "
1,"Well, if you're interested. Here's an awfully strange one: https://www.identifyus.org/en/cases/15524

Found in Vacaville, California in April of 1979. Described as ""muscular"". The third, fourth and fifth fingers of the right hand had been amputated and repaired (reportedly in a crude, unprofessional manner) years before. 

John Doe was murdered, and found on the side of the road.

Here's another weird aspect. The belt he was wearing was for ""J.Press"" which I believe at the time was a very upscale clothing maker on the East Coast. He was also wearing underwear from K-Mart! Made me think of Rain Man. "
1,"Article above states that they were that Mervyn's was primarily a California company. I used to frequent Mervyn's as a kid. It was a low end department store. Although it was primarily a California company, in 1998 they had also stores in Georgia, Florida, Arizona, Texas, Michigan and Minnesota. From the article linked to above, it seems as if they are manually comparing the fingerprint to people fingerprinted in California.

Seems as if they should add other states (including Minnesota, which is closest) to those cross checked for matches. "
1,"Interesting that you thought this. I thought that Steven Allan Davis resembled a John Doe discovered in Las Vegas in 1987: 

https://identifyus.org/cases/8137

There's a death record for Steven Allan Davis which lists a date of death of November 1st, 1986 - this corresponds to the Halloween date that he went missing:

http://death-records.mooseroots.com/l/213729265/Steven-Allan-Davis

I was guessing that he was legally declared dead on the date that he went missing. Interesting that you connected to Lyle Stevik. I hope that you e-mailed in your suspicions to law enforcement. "

2. YOU, Dysphoria, don't make sense. Maybe my 'self' is a guy, and there are no rules against being a feminine/flamboyant guy. And if someone thinks there are, they're simply projecting sexist bullshit onto others.

3. Disorder breeds disorder. I am a broken wooden post that can't hold the roof anymore. I need fixing. If I break, the roof will fall and I won't be supporting it. If I'm repaired, things will stay in place and the order is preserved. The only selfish thing here would be to push others away, give in to dysphoric thoughts, decide that everyone's against me while most likely they just don't understand why I'm breaking. That helps no one. Anyone can create disorder out of weakness, but it takes some strength to do otherwise. Fixing process may not be ideal or even long lasting, I may even decide to change things along the way, but it's a conscious attempt to create some order.

So, it is necessary to look for platforms offering a useful service and having great potential. Ether became popular because Ethereum is a revolutionary, innovative platform that provides with great opportunities to create new projects. It might sound like trusim for lots of people, but ""other"" lots of people don't understand that simple truth.

1,Sorry ;) it's my first day on the site..
1,Maybe me too :)
1,Haven't found it. Need to examine the report
1,O.K. Thank you
1,"LOL, Hulk is funny!"
1,Thanks
1,"Of course Moscow isn't happy. Imagine, how would the USA react if Russia trained Mexican forces on America's doorstep. I think it's better to find diplomatic solutions in all this story rather than train or instruct Ukrainians. We don't need a third world war, do we?"
1,LOL
1,"Run, Forrest, run!"
1,So lovely! What's his name?
1,"Speaking about US tactical nuclear weapons, just look through this document: https://www.cnduk.org/about/item/download/41"
1,"That's not just buzzword, taking into account that there are estimated to be 480 US tactical nuclear weapons in Europe, deployed in Belgium, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Turkey and Great Britain. The B-52 and B-2 bomber still retain the capability to conduct nuclear strikes, making the US one of only a handful of countries which has a 'nuclear triad' made up of nuclear-capable bombers, land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles and sea-based ballistic missiles.B-52 bombers are capable of launching nuclear-armed cruise missiles. And they even play as part of an American nuclear ""umbrella"" over South Korea and Japan."
1,"The problem is that America aspiring being the hegemon in all spheres. And its desire prevents the government from paying attention to social sphere. Yeah, we have good military and political development, but what about our social needs? What about healthcare system, education and so on? I doubt we can name the USA the most powerful nation in social issues. "
1,"Yeah, that is.."
1,"I don't know why, but the portrait reminds me Tom Hanks"
1,I don't think it's a good idea to get on Russia's nerves. As well as if the USA supports the idea of nuclear non-proliferation when for what it uses nuclear-capable bombers in military exercises in Europe? Does it want to repeat Cuban missile crisis?
1,"Of course, he can. But we shouldn't forget about his brother, who got us into two wars that were completely uncalled for and caused thousands of our troops death and horrid injuries not to mention all of the innocents that died in those countries.  I don't think Jeb will choose different foreign policy. Though, obviously, Jeb is better than Hillary."
1,"I want this cup!!
"
1,"Oh, yeah, that's true!
"
1,"This situation reminds me what happens inside the US. As American airlines treat with disabled people, our government treats with veterans. "
1,"Not only social media, but also CEO, writing articles, etc.
Numbers are random, Instagram is not on the 7th place."
1,"Thanks for your answer. Look, I have online tattoo shop and I should run campaign from zero. I have an experience promoting different stuff on social media, but I don't know how to turn my experience into real sales. Also, that's my first try in this niche."
1,"Good guide, recommendation to scan the entire market is definitely very useful, especially considering the number of altcoins on the market. If you decided to invest in altcoins, do a thorough research and choose wisely. As for me, I invested in TIE and SPHR. It doesn't mean that you also have to. You have to buy tokens on the basis of your own analysis, not on the basis of shillers on reddit.  "
1,They produced one hell of a dinner party let me tell you
1,Tfw you realise you are in the top 10%
1,OR if ether breaks btc market cap 
1,"So, here is my portfolio. But please do your own research.

IOTA

XRP

IOTA

TIE

SPHR
"
1,ENJ
1,Here we go.
1,"An exchange listing only 3 coins in 2018. It is a joke, isn't it? "
1,I would single out TIE and SPHR 
1,"Okay, and what about LTC? "
1,"Top Lan

But which of them is doing those English translations?
"
1,Thanks for the share.
1,"So, here is my portfolio in no specific order for those curious. But please do your own research.

XRP (unlike the author of the post, I do think that it has a big potential) 

IOTA

TIE

SPHR"
1,TIE and SPHR 
1,Germany seems to be a technological laggard. It looks like nobody who works in German government is interested in crypto. 
1,Do you really think that they will add ripple on Coinbase? 
1,Have been thinking about buying Sphere and already bought Ties since I like the idea underlying the project. What do you think? Shill me some tokens you have recently bought. 
1,Giancarlo 2020
1,That's still about infinitely more than gdax or Bitstamp
1,Inside job 
1,I would recommend to keep a close eye on TIE and SPHR
1,Ties.DB and Sphere are pretty interesting altcoins 
1,"Yeah, it is Cryptural Selection "
1,Undervalued doesn't necessarily mean that it's not overhyped 
1,Stellar news!
1,One of the best meme posts in this subreddit ever  
1,Take a look at Ties.DB and Sphere 
1,"I might be downvoted, but here we go

XRP

IOTA

TIE

SPHR
"
1,Great headline. Excellent. 
1,Good news!
1,They do it in order to launder money. 
1,They have to pay tax on the medal. Would they have to pay tax on the bitcoin?
1,"I recommend you forget trading and:

(1) Do analysis of good coins/tokens, paying more attention to coins/tokens that are not very popular (I chose Ties and Sphere, not shilling, just sharing my experience). (2) Buy those that look legitimate and have good prospects. (3) HODL, live your life and don't worry "
1,I would recommend to keep a close eye on TIE and SPHR
1,Any publicity is good publicity right?
1,Of course I sold right before this announcement 
1,It looks like 2018 will be an excellent year for IOTA. 
1,Android wallet planned?
1,"Not really. Early majority, probably. "
1,Great way to drive the innovation
1,"It is a fact that current decentralized data storage systems don't satisfy needs of crypto community. If this one does, crypto fans all over the world will get rid of many problems. "
1,Just tell us which coins are the Amazones or Googles and we will hold long-term.
1,This dude gets it. Thanks for the post. 
1,"This stuff takes time, patience is your best friend now."
1,I can relate
1,Rebound could take two years 
1,Way too soon.
1,"You are right, your swift transfer is instant and free"
1,I wasn’t selling for 2 years regardless. Not fucking selling. 
1,"I made a decision to switch to unpopular and promising tokens. Have been thinking about buying Enigma and already bought Ties since I like the idea underlying the project. What do you think? Shill me some tokens you have recently bought.  


"
1,Here in my garaaaaaaaaaage
1,There is one question: Is he still alive?
1,Fuck all deposits. Let Bittrex first address the thousands of complaints regarding withdrawals. 
1,"I wanna take my profits and won't leave this NOT sinking ship 

I just changed my strategy and bought promising tokens, including Enigma and Ties. 
 "
1,First they mock us. Then they fight us. Then we win.
1,"I consider myself an early adopter and, frankly, I am tired of all those morons who entered the crypto market to make fast money and, as a result, blemished it. 

In this situation the best decision would be to choose several unpopular cryptos in the hope that one of them will grow substantially. There a lot of projects, I have chosen Ties and SALT because I like the ideas these platforms are based on 

 "
1,The future is already here. 
1,"Not those people who bought in December, lol"
1,"""Cryptos are just like a box of chocolate... you never know what you gonna get"""
1,Jack is a piece of shit though. 
1,Running on IOTA Tangle! Great choice.
1,The lesson I learned this month is to pay more attention to the platforms that are not very popular but can be useful and create value for consumers. That's why I decided to buy SALT and TIES tokens.  
1,"These crooks are trying to manipulate so ""wisely""... Crypto community is under attack by Wall Street swindlers owning mass media"
1,"There are several tendencies that can explain why lots of people are sure that Ethereum is going to significantly increase this year. 

First of all, Bitcoin, many people think, has already started to decay. The price of Bitcoin felt, and it's impossible to predict whether it will recover or not. 

Secondly, in contrast to Bitcoin that is considered as a mostly speculative instrument, Ethereum is a powerful platform giving a lot of opportunities to create new projects.

Thirdly, it is important to note that 80% of the daily transactions across a lot of coins run on Ethereum which means that it has a strong position.

I am not saying that the price of Ethereum will definitely increase. It is impossible to predict. But there are several chances that it can increase. 
 

 "
1,Did you really use a cryptocurrency connected yo your bank account to do illegal things? Genius.  
1,I would definitely try an Android version 
1,"I have been thinking about buying Enigma tokens. I also read about other platforms, I would single out Ties, the idea of professional network on blockchain seems great"
1,The fact that ICX is not worth $20 or even more yet baffles me 
1,"But Litecoin was created exactly for this purpose, wasn't it? "
1,"Advertisement fucked up. 

Moreover, the article is filled with misinformation. Bitstamp has already got a license to work in EU. "
1,The project that aims to create a professional network looks interesting. I have several business ideas but don't know how to realize them. Platforms like this one can be extremely useful.  
1,"Well, the fact that there're similarities between animals and humans doesn't mean we evolved from them."
1,"Did you  notice that wherever you find complicated stupid nonsense borders, you also find the British at some point in History? Curious coincidence?﻿ By the way, what kind of assent is that?"
1,"I think this is cool) But people shouldn't depend on this anytime they want to write or draw. It can take away our artistic skills.
It could be used for certificates and VIP cards and stuffs like that."
1,"Languages have been there and dynamically transforming since the Tower of Babel. People knew that other people spoke different languages. 
I believe that there were people who learnt other languages most especially that of their enemies so they could be of great importance or service to their Kingdom. Kings had translators and in cases where someone becomes a stranger in another land... if he's not understood, he could try to communicate with signs so as to be understood. Of course not fully as it's even similar case today in a modern world. While they travel from place to place, they learn new languages. I hope this can help answer some questions."
1,"If we don't protect our world today, global warming and other natural disasters can ruin our beautiful cities and tomorrow it will be forgotten."
1,"Isn't there freedom of speech anymore? Moreover, he's just a DJ - playing songs to excite the people. Why didn't they fine all those who danced to the song???"
1,You're right. we have to ban toddlers and children from using guns.
1,I think those cops are disabled in their minds and don't deserve to serve in the police force again or live among people.
1,Awesome inspiration) Never giving up on what she started no matter how long it took her and the challenges that came her way.
1,He got what he deserved.
1,"I think that the controversy between BLM and ALM is just simple. White dude, we know that every life is important but Black Lives are not been treated as such. So BLM is there to create awareness and help stop the discrimination. Meanwhile, creators of ALM think that they are being racist in protesting for ONLY BLACK LIVES.  "
1,"I think they only portray what's going on in real and not trying to create White Supremacy through their movies. Possibly you're right, who knows their main agenda? "
1,When a lot of people get crazy about simple things that could have been avoided; killing Blacks and arresting them even though they posed no threat have angered a lot of people. And that's the results we see in these people...
1,Bernie was just cornered by this guy.
1,Most followers get into the extreme in protecting the man they believe in and this Trump fan is one of them.
1,"So true, black is beautiful and we will refuse to be what people think of us."
1,"The word 'privilege' wasn't a racist term till people begun to think that other people were more important and superior and deserved special treatment than others. So, when I'm reminded to ""know my privileges,"" how the hell do you think that's not racism?"
1,"They were scared he was going to react... Even after he passed by without punching back. what the fuck!?
If he had gone offensive, he would have been shot possibly."
1,"First of all, America is a multicultural, inter-racial nation. Until we put our differences aside and begin to respect and honor one another, there will always be misunderstanding, hatred and chaos. The key to solving this is love, love for one another. And since everyone is capable of love, there's still hope for us."
1,It's a good thing which shows great concern. But making the law is one thing... Enforcing it is most important.
1,Hey! I agree with you because not only blacks are poor. There are very rich Black Americans as well as very poor Whites.
1,"BLM's aggressiveness was supposed to be in such a way that if an opponent is aggressive, then they meet him likewise. But things are getting a bit overboard... Whether we like it or not, history might repeat itself if we're not sensitive to the measures we use to be heard or fight for our rights."
1,"If by the same reason of having early stages of ALS, he murdered his wife and her sister, now that his case has worsen, won't he be of much threat? "
1,"Frodo: FUCK TRUMP!! >:-(
Donald: Frodo, you get a little angry when you're hungry.  Eat a Snickers.
Frodo: eats the snickers
Donald: Better?
Frodo: NO.  FUCK TRUMP!!! >:-(﻿"
1,"let's say these facts have spoken for themselves... so if we're not safe in our own country, then there's no need investing huge sums of money in our defense system directed towards external enemies. We have to solve the battles within..."
1,"Good one there, at the rate that now cops are being reprimanded in different states, they would be careful in their operations and not act stupidly or shoot an unarmed person."
1,"What the hell is going on here...??? no one is safe in the hands of these cops who are bent on finding something wrong with any black man walking down the street.
What on God's earth did he do to deserve such intimidating arrest?"
1,maybe when they want to go insane and forget about every pain... they take in anything that makes them high ... lol
1,"Other cops should learn from his fate as a result of his foolishness.
He should have learnt how to rightly use his 1st Amendment rights :D"
1,"Until cops get to know that they are not above the law, they will continue killing us :("
1,"On his patrol car was written, ""Dedicated to Protect,"" yet his action proves he's Dedicated to Kill or Destroy innocent lives."

1,Kasparov is a former USSR and they all were corrupt but as well known 'old habits die hard'.
1,Because in reality we substitute the multiculturalism with hypocritical polite correctness banning our own traditions to make some strangers' life more comfortable which is not so evident after all either.  
1,And that's really horrible because we lose ourselves in this way gaining nothing instead. Maybe we cannot live now without this alleged polite correctness but in such cases I hate it and find it purely hypocritical. 
1,"You are correct and they'd rather rebuilding Rome than curbing this migrant influx or they need even more time to reallocate all those incoming migrants all about Europe or better to destroy ISIS in Syria and Iraq, stop wars over there and send all these refugees and migrants back to their homes if it's yet possible after all.

1,Well really the price of such a settlement seems too high for those relatives. Moreover it's a precedent and now to be settled in Canada they'll start sinking their children by dozens definitely. 
1,"Really I hope so too because otherwise it means a war between NATO and Russia probably backed by China but in this case it can lead to WWIII eventually. 
"
1,"The price is too high. Well besides after it the rest will start to drown their kids too just to be settled somewhere in Canada, the States or Europe. "
1,Well it looks like preparation for a war between Turkey and Russia - first Russia has nearly banned its citizens to go to Turkey and now Turkey has done the same. Some bad risky situation for the whole world really I guess.

At least NEO and OMG are keeping me happy today"
1,That feel when trading my TRX for TIE and ICX. I regret nothing.
1,Well his vice prime minister had a met up with Universa Blockchain last week!
1,So it seems any country with a declining currency and sanctions against them is going to be getting into crypto.
1,How else is he supposed to get his money out of Russia with the Magnitsky sanctions in place?
1,Nice! How safe is a chrome extension wallet? Will it be possible to store offline via paper wallet? 
1,"Just to be realistic, virtually every coin has tanked off news gains within a week. Icx will probably do the same. Bravo on the wallet, great news for lth’s, but dont expect a moon anytimesoon from this or any other news. I predict sub $4 icx within 24 hours. Maybe 72."

1,What platform is recommended to get into/purchase TIE?
1,"I agree with you that Zcash is underestimated. It's much better than Monero. 

As for this list, I didn't know about Storm, and it seems doubtful. Enigma, SALT and Ties are indeed promising. "

1,It's interesting that they will search multiple exchanges to match the best price to each order. I wonder how they will avoid piling up coins on lower price exchanges and piling up USD on higher price exchanges. Are they limiting to domestic exchanges that are quicker/easier for arbitrage?
1,Well needed Conbase competition.
1,This is an absolute game changer and will definitely lead to a Bitcoin bull rally once successfully launched.

1,"Oh good. Here I was wondering when the ethereum sub would be flooded again with stories of what Dr Nicholas Judge, PhD, Founder Of RootProject And Savior Of Humanity, had for breakfast (also, did you hear Doctor Judge is a PhD? it's true!).

Anyway, what's the going rate for a 4 months old Reddit account with 290 karma from r/AskReddit? Asking for... reasons.
"
1,Bitcoin has gone bust on all its early ideological promises.
1,Being honest to yourself is the first step to improvement.
1,I hope this phrasing won't provoke any backlash from regulators. BTC is not fast (fast is not measurable even) and it's definitely not low-fee. Imagine SEC saying that BTC is a scam because of lacking information and half truths on the website. 
1,"I have serious question about this lightning network thing, how come everyone have to implement their own version? Shouldn't it just a library and an api?"
1,"I'm kicking myself for not buying bitcoins when thy were $200 each.

And $800 each.

And $2,000 each...."
1,Hind sight is always 20-20 . Don’t bash the poor soul. Why OP if you were so smart why didn’t you grab bitcoins worth 10$ at 3 cents a piece and retire now in 2017
1,"Ok, so lets assume she took the offer, and was paid with bitcoin. She holds it until today, when it's now worth 1.4 billion USD. She decides to cash it out for USD. Who and how would this be possible?

How would one go about cashing that much bitcoin out into USD or any other (fiat currency) amount for that matter?"
1,We have already seen it. Bitcoin price dropped over 30% in a few weeks. Resembles what we’re witnessing now. 
1,"Even though I don't consider myself veteran (I've been trading for 2 years), I confirm it. "
1,"Well yes, of course it is a huge problem. They ask us to give them our money, they ask us to give them our trust. Then you find out they copied from others. Chinese copy everything continuously. I live in China, I studied in China, I work in China and I am married to a Chinese and the most disgusting thing is they copy everything and they think it is right to do. "
1,"I jumped ship. No regrets, whether it grows tenfold or not."
1,"Safest bets. I'm here to make money. If you want safe, invest in Google or Apple."
1,They havent heard of ICON(ICX)....
1,I bet alibabas stock is probably going up because of all these specs haha. Trx can at least say they’re poaching solid engineers
1,I'd love to see this laid out in a map showing how they all connect. Just reading it was mind blowing but seeing it all laid out in front of you... Jeez.
1,If Ronaldo mentioned ripple it would go to $100 after a few days.
1,"I have been talking about it all the time. Banks are the biggest bubble of them all. Also we seem to never learn from it. Every 50 years or so, the banks go bankrupt and we just remake the same system over and over again. To be honest, it's not even a bubble. It's a loop."
1,Buy the rumors sell the news
1,"Fluffy is on point, as always. The guy pulls no punches, but there is some seriously fishy business with Justin Sun."
1,This is excellent. I have so many dev questions. 
1,"On StackOverflow someone can post a problem (computer science, software dev. / engineering), and others respond with constructive feedback or solutions. Good news for stellar dev community."
1,XLM is about to moon pretty damn hard. Has been heavily manipulated for 4-5 days while big players have neem accumulating.
1,Thanks for posting. Checked this blog and found it pretty interesting 
1,Nice project
1,"Any plans to add a price display on the icon itself? I have a Bitcoin tracker that offers that, and it's nice to be able to just glance up at it without clicking.

I am not a great programmer but might be able to help with this if you're interested.
"
1,Love it! only bug or issue i have found on mobile (android) when you type an amount in then hit enter it resets it. If you click back it's fine thought. Butits perfect anyhoo! thank you!
1,hmmmm...interesting...didn't learn a damn thing...
1,"Man, Brad is so reassuring. Makes me smile thinking that I invested in such a great company! Go xrp!"
1,"Yes, let's all stop using computers and go back to sticks and stones. FFS neckbeards.

My bitcoins are in Electrum. Come and get them if you 1337 hackers are so awesome.

1,do they use Segwit addresses?
1,bitcoin hater running bitcoin exchange? what a nonsense
1,there's no reason to be so paranoid
1,"Finally, it is open to the public. "
1,I would recommend you to invest in TIES
1,Never heard about ties before. Thanks for posting!
1,"Would Ether delta return the money to those who lost it? How would they go about doing that?

"
1,I hope its true. It would send massive fear in all these shitty crypto hackers trying to ruin the community
1,and verge has been overtaken by bitconnect a true ponzi rather than a poor altcoin.
1,"Yep.Verge are the most lying, shilling, idiotic goup in crypto. They have a cult-like belief in their tech. Cultish because they will believe whatever cool videos say or what a cool guy with a snake tatoo says, but won't research the code for themselves. If they did this even slightly they'd quickly discover that the tech is BS. More articles about their BS is needed since more suckers keep flocking to it.

Still, I suppose that's good that they all flock to Verge since it keeps the loons away from the rest of the cryptospace."
1,"Now if we can just get it on Blockfolio too, that'd be greaat."
1,This is a different show on CNBC from the show that interviewed Roger. Roger was interviewed on Fast Money. This show is some midday show whose name I can't recall.
1,"Lies, lies and lies. It seems also that the media and Blockstream are now friends so they can ruin BCH."
1,CNBCash is that a new alt-coin?
1,"Great to see bussines engagement at beta stage, this should allow for fast adoption."
1,"This is so cool, I guess we can use this in a few months with released Lightning wallet"
1,I'm looking forward to testing it myself on working btc chain. Until then I just wait.
1,"Came for Bitcoin, stayed for the drama."
1,"There is no volume. The price is going up because the people that are trading it are emptying their bank accounts to prop up the price.

Compared to last Friday's volume of 82k, this is nothing and you should be careful about buying at these highs."
1,How soon can this happen? Need to know when to sell my GBTC in my IRA!
1,"Oh boy. This is going to send the already-moon BTC to a moon in another galaxy.

This is also a very strong case to put a good portion of your portfolio in BTC."
1,"Biggest reason I'm bullish on this tech is all the criticism I'm reading here is inaccurate or outright wrong. There are concerns with lightning, I've had a good chat with an info-tech pro about some specific potential concerns. Non of those arguments have been listed here.

Short version is, hosts will have to have a step or two better security than someone just running a Bitcoin node. For now keep it to small transactions and keep channel funding low to keep your exposure limited.

In the meantime expect attacks. Co-ordinated, well funded attacks.

Anecdotally I've had some trouble getting LM working reliably on testnet (My fault and high learning curve to blame). But this has some next-level potential."
1,'Pump and dump of the day.'
1,This is going so fast I cannot even see it! unreal!
1,TL;DR - Reddit is the biggest threat to Bitcoin.
1,"I feel like this is so important and not enough people in crypto realize this. The real enemy is the banks and the more we stick together, the better chance we have of freeing ourselves from the current financial system."
1,20 cents? 43 cents! I agree this coin has top 50 potential﻿
1,this is the only site that I need when I have trouble with pending transactions
1,Why XLM over REQ?
1,"""The folks at Stellar, like us, want to see the world move past the 40 + year old fragmented system that we all suffer in today, but move towards a system that is more fair and equitable for all."" For me it's clearly pointing FairX what do you think guys ? "
1,This is actually legit as fuck.
1,This may be the most important and impressive application of this new technology .﻿
1,"Xrb brags about 7,000 TPS.

Lol.
"
1,"Amazing just how many projects are launching in quick succession. This platform has real substance, it can no longer be ignored. If we stay sub $100 for long I'd be very surprised."
1,"Much gains

Such money
"
1,If it does hit $1000 then there will be a lot of early retirements around here. 
1,$1000 if there is only 1/100th of total XRP still around.
1,"Without doing my due diligence and not being familiar with this card and $CTR this all raises one question for me:

To whom did the XRP go? If sent to CTR this doesn't seem to be at all what XRP is expected to be or look like, but just a trusted third party acting as immediate brokerage. And was this XRP change logged on the ledgers at this moment or is it essentially the two-payment-paradox but now done with extra steps because Ripple?

Love and support Ripple but this interaction seems to be presenting itself as something it is not unless my understanding is off.
"
1,"They have ethereum listed as ethereal, and they say token erc20 instead of erc20 token, I wouldn’t put any money on them"
1,More people need to be informed about this. Every one was so concerned about insider trading with the GDAX BCash fiasco but didn't even consider bit trading as a likely cause.
1,"It's stores value, but it's not a ""store of value"". Mkay. And it's not ""Satoshi's True Vision"" either. You got us! Bitcoin is doomed."
1,What's the TLDW on this vid
1,"as far as I know it doesn't use blockchain technology. so, I would prefer VIMANA
"
1,bitcoin is not the reason for GPU prices ... it hasn't been profitable on GPU in years ... even with the recent price run up 
1,Very good news for IOTA
1,Good to see the partnerships starting. Bee Token sounds interesting as well; seems like a blockchain Airbnb concept. Live alpha happening in San-Francisco in Q1 2018.
1,"yea I like monero and also other alt coins like EOS

But I am still going to hold my bitcoin
"
1,Soon you will find it in 300 range. Need regulation. Companies are changing their name to block chain and skyrocket
1,Can anybody confirm this? This seems to be the only publication mentioning it. Find it hard to believe that this wouldn't be bigger news
1,"Coretards, we ride!"
1,Uh pretty sure you're only supposed to be thinking about aliens right now. Thanks. -the government
1,"Why did I buy in on this? ""Bitcoin Jesus?"" I'm selling this shitcoin the second it sniffs a satoshi in the green for me. Might just take a loss and move on to better projects."
1,Crypto will never replace precious metals. Nothing will. Because Crypto is man made precious metals are not.﻿
1,"Well, it might. We are moving outside the realm of crypto kiddies and into the realm of big investors. Do you think they would like to have a fragile scam coin like bch to hold their billions? I don't think so"
1,It is like the Monkey''s story and all those foolish guys who have invested are going to repent

1,"My doc scared the shit outta me. He found ""something"" on my lung and scheduled me for another x ray in a month.

That month, 15 years ago, I quit. It was the hardest thing I've ever done. It was the worst month of my life.

After the next x ray and about 10 years of annual visits to the lung specialist, nothing ever developed and I was given a clean bill of health.

Nothing like a cancer scare to get you to quit smoking.

1,"My friends and I were on the subway and a homeless man came and sat across from us. He had a bottle of vodka and a cup full of change. He looked at my blonde friend and said ""you have pretty hair, you must be a viking."" He then put the cup of change to his lips, tilted it back, coughed/choked a little, and said ""What goes in must come out!"""
1,This kid named Alex in my elementary school once filled an entire sheet of printer paper with his blood by giving himself numerous paper cuts and rubbing his fingers on the paper. He showed it off at school just to show off his weirdness.

What not to do: focus on the need for a girlfriend. We can smell it on you. It smells like boring. Be interesting instead. That smells like... I dunno, whatever attractive smells like.

1,My inability to figure out what l want with my life. No goals or motivation to see myself succeed

1,"The Hagakure

A man was raised as a Samurai, but when he was finally of age to serve, his master died, and he was not allowed to commit seppuku. It was the beginning of a hundred years of peace, and thus this Samurai of a proud clan had to sit by and watch society fall apart, as the martial path fell to the wayside.

As an old man, a young scribe would sit and chat with him, and write down all his nuggets of wisdom.

It's written very much like the ramblings of an old man, and sometimes contradicts itself, but it is a guide to living by action, honour, and accountability.

Though it is a few hundred years old, it is shocking how many parallels there are between his society and ours today.

1,About to get around 150 in fiat. Currently have XLM/TIE/XSPEC. What’s a good option? More xlm or maybe neo? 
1,"Cmon ETH and TIE , smash those walls!"
1,I 'm holding TIE. But damn maybe I should be converting other holdings. This is crazy.
1,"So remind me again...why is bitcoin cash the number 4 crypto by market cap when there are projects such as NEO, Stellar, Ties.Network, IOTA, ext... behind it? "
1,Sold my all my WTC for NEO & TIE. The news was way to shady to be putting my trust and money into a company like that. 
1,Thoughts on my portfolio. XLM 40% ETH 35% TIE 22% TKY 3%. 
1,Any large company adopting Crypto is a huge plus in my book! Keep it coming! 
1,This is like Magikarp transforming into Gyarados. 
1,"if you send me 0,5eth I will reduce fees by 25% for you.."
1,"Great, even though some of the coins will still have insane fees, this is a step in the right direction"
1,This is super awesome. Thanks for your work.
1,"This is basically two second layer Bitcoin networks talking to each other, right? Coinbase is a custodial second layer network, and LN is a decentralized second layer network, both rely on base layer BTC security, right?"
1,Wow... this is awesome! Coinbase to Lightning and no fee at all. Great work!
1,I expect the USPS to be the very last entity to adapt to the changing world.

1,Worst part is that people don't realize India probably has daily volumes of less than 3500 btc. It really has no impact on the global markets.
1,Its legal status is akin to Prostitution in India. The government has walked from any financial protection to any or who fall in the ponzi schemes based on crypto like Bitconnect.

1,What's a good altcoin to buy in the dip now? I Just bought some btc at 10k and TIE at $0.27 but might hold that or look into other alts.
1,Does this app collect any information except anonymous analytics? For example are balances of different currencies or what exchanges are used tracked?

1,So samsung is making high powered memory miners?
1,Well.. They do build more than just phones. They can even hook you up with a fridge. Industrial conglomerates are talented like that.
1,Looking forward to this release. Big kudos to all the devs. 
1,Seems like a pretty good investment
1,It offers a solution to this soaring problem and caters to the acute needs of the current IT and crypto community. That's great!
1,I’m glad there wasn’t anything to artificially inflate the price. Steady increases! 
1,Hmm. I'd love to have some SDEX right about now.
1,Why does Stellar need the Lightning Network if the transactions on the mainnet are already fast?
1,"Stellar + Lightning is an amazing combination. Also, can't wait for FairX & SDEX"
1,SDEX exchange and Stellar using lightning to scale even more!! 
1,So... what're you thoughts on Raiblocks?
1,"At this point I'm not even worried about Stellar increasing in price, it's just awesome to be a part of such a realistic and worthy team"
1,I highly doubt they would make an exchange.
1,They tested Ripple on their networks. Google it. 
1,Companies do this to protect their brand. Amazon could be looking into an exchange - but these domains aren’t a good indicator. 
1,It’s time to instant XRB be put on the exchange. 
1,"Interestingly, amazonbitcoin.com already resolves to amazon.com."
1,The first news was six banks agreed to do so the new news is now we have a date officially and a confirmation that all six will do it on the same date!!
1,Still the price won't go up. Possible that Korea FUD wasn't the reason for the drop?
1,Not sure if this is a good idea. It's up to the investor to do the research and set their own guidelines on what they're willing to invest in. 
1,"“ratings also define what trades many fund managers are allowed to take part in.“

This is the key to the whole thing. Now funds and institutions will be able to begin to trade crypto out of the shadows....hence the reason institutional money has beat down all of the prices for 3 weeks behind the scenes with manipulation and fake Korea news. They don’t buy at ATH’s
"
1,I would take these rating with a grain of salt. 
1,"They probably rate stuff as f and then they buy a lot of the f, then switch it to a and reap the benefits. An actual fud/fomo machine"
1,"Nem is probably the best blockchain on the list IMHO. I like XRP, but XEM should be A+."
1,"Maybe I'm blind, but I saw this wasn't here, and I just ran across it and feel like it should be... also with the Weiss Ratings Agency coming up tomorrow, we might want to work on making sure anything XEM / NEM newsworthy is posted here and discussed by the experts."
1,I don't think NEM even has smart-contract capability yet.
1,"Well luckily we're invested in something that is the fastest, most realiable, most scalable, best fundamentals"
1,I wonder if the G20 summit could have large implications on the price?
1,"Brace yourself, Moon! TIE is coming ;)"
1,why the other crypto projects don't involve the community as much?
1,"I am so confused about why people feel REQ is shifting development work to people. I am a developer and when I read this my gut feeling was ""This is cool, as a true REQ fan I can get paid to be an early adopter of the platform"".

REQ is building a platform, I interpreted the post as a way they are trying to incentivize the community to build various use cases for the protocol.

ETH started a fund a couple weeks ago to support teams that wanted to help with scaling, why was this not looked on negatively?

Thinking that REQ is gonna build all these use cases for their platform is insane, it's like expecting ETH to build all the Dapps or Apple to build all the apps for the iPhone. calm down guys."
1,"Wow, actually this is really good. I still see some Redditors posting their apps made thru Blockchain frameworks just for fun. Now more devs will be motivated by the fact that there is a company out there that will support their ideas. Funding is really an issue when you're just starting your project. Kudos to REQ team!"
1,No idea how you would not consider this to be a bullish update. They are using their ICO funding for further development of their product in the most transparant way: by involving the community. If this isn't the ultimate sign of a company that believes in its own product and roadmap then I don't know what is?
1,"This is a train wreck thread full of people who don't know anything.

If you think decentralizing development for building on top of the product(not core product) is bad, then go look up the City of Zion and tell me how that's working out.

Day traders who are disappointed with anything less then mainnet launch/ and or partnership announcements with Amazon need to go away. There are plenty of pump and dump coins out there.

REQ has never moved on news."
1,"So Req decides to actually “decentralize” the development of the project and people are giving them shit for it? Saying “oh they couldn’t meet their goals, they couldn’t get things done” Decentralization is the core of blockchain and when a project actually makes and effort to decentralize their development they are hung for it. It’s pathetic seeing how some people are viewing this announcement. It anything it brings more confidence to the Req project. You think if the team was so far behind meeting timelines they’d want to bring it outside devs who could easily leak detrimental news about being behind on milestones with absolutely no repercussions to them? If the community views an announcement like this negatively you really need to re-evaluate your alleged support for “decentralization”."
1,Someone should tell them about Ethereum
1,I like the idea this platform is based on. The blockchain-powered platform that is created for business-minded people and professionals has a lot of potential.

1,"Unless lightning drastically brings the fees down for on chain transactions. Using altcoins for one-off small transactions will still be vastly cheaper and easier.

Just transferring a few hundred bucks to the lightning network will cost over $20 in fees. Sure you can move them around after that for a pittance, but even if it's free you'd have to use that few hundred dollars in over 400 transactions to break even with bch or litecoins $0.05 fees."
1,"right now there are many useless altcoins, people trading them and their value grow day after day. Usage is not the only factor of existing a coin. I believe propaganda can keep many useless coins in the game."

Bitcoin is a One way transaction process that isn't reversible and from one perspective this is a weakness but from another it means that there's no central authority to say NO YOU CAN'T DONATE TO THAT, you can't do that! or we're concerned fraud might have been involved and need to do bookkeeping and put you through an EXTREMELY bureaucratic process to receive your funds.﻿"

1,"Philosophy.

Seriously I only discovered what philosophy actually is until after I left school. Not only is it really interesting but it's really helpful. Philosophy teaches you to question what you're faced with, and approach problems with logic not belief. It's the cure for gullibility and ignorance. It helps you take control of your base emotions and think clearly. This is coming from someone who used to be seriously irrationally angry over very tiny things in his life. That fucking sucked. But now for the life of me, I just can't see the point in putting myself through pain like that.

Maybe that's not terrible in the bigger picture with that possibly being like a couple weeks of gains? Also, I'm curious if in the next year or two we'll see something similar that he can adjust some of his funds to crypto without leaving his current plan at all, if any of it is self directed (vs a school pension or something where it's completely managed).

Are you seeking out women who have hairy legs, wear moomoos and crocs? No? Then don't expect anyone to want you looking that way either. 3) have a job, or at least a fulfilling duty or purpose in life such as full time school or volunteer work or whatever. You need to show you have motivation to complete a task and the self discipline and commitment to keep doing it. Nobody wants to date a bum. 4) just try asking the person out. Just try to put yourself out there and ask someone if they're interested in a coffee or whatever. The worst that can happen is that person says no thankyou.

All that's said is the various government agencies are going to ""look at"" and ""change"" the suggestion of banning trading.

1,"Bella Thorne.

She’s a decent actress it’s just she gives off too much of “I’m not your typical girl next door” vibe that I hate her.

Also I’m positive that if I was 13 I would have loved her.

1,Just whyyyyyy... that feel when trading my tie tokens for Zcash and ICX the other day actually ended up being a bad move.
1,"Hey tie folks, at least you’re not having as bad of a day as zclassic holders."
1,Looks like it's better to wait until they iron out the kinks on this update. The manager won't load the new firmware and there are people having issues with updating the MCU
1,"When I set my ledger up, it needed a firmware update and then gave me a new seed. Says it wont happen again, but not sure if i trust the update"
1,I'm unable to uninstall or install any new apps. I don't get any confirmations on my ledger when trying to do either. Anybody have this problem before?
1,"My Ledger is stuck on the MCU/Bootloader stage.

Do not update your ledger. It is a very clunky update.

Have a look in the Ledger wallet sub, heaps of people now have expensive paperweights...
"
1,"There's still a significant part of the population who thinks BTC is a physical coin with a ""B"" on it that somehow costs 10,000 USD.

Unbeliveable, but true. The people who invested on the run-up to 20k didn't really understand what they invested in. And they probably wont be back.
"
1,"the real problem with getting public money into crypto is the mentality of, ""it already 100x'd like 4 times, there's NO WAY it will ever do that again. i'm not going to put my money in something that has no chance of going up now""

also no one has the patience to wait on 0 gains for 4 years until the rockets engage
"
1,"It’s good stuff and adds to the case. (Admittedly I scan read some) But I saw nothing about consequences for non compliance with guidelines, which I would imagine would be written somewhere -if they (the guidelines) are to have any meaningful impact."
1,This really is the Wild West.
1,"It's my feeling with this and the slow death of the twitter wars, that these bozos have overplayed their hand. Sell your Zcash, Enigma and Spectre now if you have any, before these coins crater!"
1,This was a very well directed FUD attack with lots of interested parties. The people involved should be barred from journalism and academia.

1,Bank of A where we charge you $300 a year for the privilege of giving us your cash. 
1,They said in the article that it obscures any sort of tracking they can do on the money and makes it harder for them to comply to all of the laws that they must adhere to. So the title might be a little misleading. 
1,"It still has to go through the House before it becomes law.

1,Would be better if they'd pay returns in crypto
1,"And if the said crypto used for paying taxes increases in value, will Arizona need to pay capital gain taxes to the federal government?

It would be hypocritical if he called it 'bcore'.

1,Is it wrong to giggle like a school girl even though I'm a fully grown man whenever Bitcoin Judas gets his due?
1,"I'm very glad he addressed this and explained to people how complicated this process is for Binance. Anyone who thinks that a withdrawal fee can equal the network transaction fee is delusional. I'll gladly pay a premium for the extra security and peace of mind.

I would much rather see a coordinated effort to address the dust issue.
"
1,"I like the vision that Colin has. I think he's doing as Steve Jobs did with computers, but with cryptos. Like bringing the currency to normal people that hasn't no idea how it works, unlike the majority of crypto enthusiasts. As he said, it will get integrations and integrations bringing to masses.﻿"

1,The best Satoshi Nakamoto ever﻿
1,I wish they kept the logo
1,I really liked the idea of calling Rai but I have to agree that Nano sounds alot more sophisticated. I'm actually surprised this name hasn't been used before.
1,"Good, I always read it as Railblocks for some reason."
1,This explains the delayed Binance listing. XRB will be NANO
1,I guess the Binance listing has waited for this as well. Exciting times for Nano! 
1,I would bet Binance lists in the next few days. Would make sense for them to have waited for rebrand. 
1,Tidex
1,Is this basically the step after the testnet ? does this help with POS/POW hybrid or is this something else? ELI5 please 
1,Last time there was a Casper update the price started climbing. Hopefully it happens again! Get your ETH to stake!
1,"If USD goes down, does that make the USD value of Bitcoin go up?"
1,Can anyone find the the drop from 2011 where BTC hit $0.01 for about a minute and jumped back up to about $15 - $17. I've been looking for it everywhere but its almost as if everyone forgot about it.
1,Now we need lightning wallet.
1,Innovation everywhere. I am getting really excited about LN!
1,"Wow, Doug is THE MAN."
1,"This is a really great summary of how Roger became such a provocative figure through his lies, deceit and manipulation. The video only scratches the surface, but it's really a must watch for anyone just getting involved in cryptocurrency.

As a sidenote, I think it's ironic that any content which is even remotely critical of Ver gets reported in an attempt to get it removed, as if people shouldn't know about Ver's shady and dishonest past.
"
1,Sell BTC holding for VEN and ICX this year?
1,We've seen many projects and icos that got rekt by security or wallet issues. I'm glad Vechain step up their game and prepare for the worst.
1,At first glance Vechain seems promising and I've decided to invest a little bit into it. But I don't understand why all the comments are 100% either in support of Vechain or against Vechain. I agree this accomplishment does seem news-worthy. But I do also see Vechain posts a lot on here. I understand people being excited about their coins but is that what is actually causing people to dismiss recent news from Vechain? Are there other factors causing people to dismiss Vechain other than being bombarded with news about it?
1,"Just read the article after seeing the tweet pop up. Very exciting, it's a step in the right direction and this will help people take VeChain more seriously when looking to transition. VeChain seems to be doing everything right at the moment :) it's nice to see companies starting to come up with solutions for mass adoption and gaining trust. "
1,"Huge for enterprise adoption, while showing VeChain and PwC are committed to supporting the crypto-based business ecosystem VEN holders have invested in.

Bullish.
"
1,TLDR: moon
1,"This is absolutely a huge project / platform they're envisioning. If even half of the use cases and their own protocol examples would come together then it would an extreme player on so many levels.

Well you can't reach the sky and all that if you don't aim high enough. Hopefully with the libraries, and their community fund they'll get the crucial community support and spawned projects to take them to their ambitious levels.
"
1,"I have just checked the price of this cryptocurrency. It plunged significantly during the common prices drop this week. But now it's starting to recover, it might be a good moment to buy it.  "
1,The transparent system that confirms reputation of entrepreneurs and specialists and thus enhances business communications is exactly what global business community needs now. 
1,I am waiting for people who will scream that this time is different 
1,Thank you
1,"In my opinion, there are no reasons to be optimistic. "
1,"about the chart: the volumes are low, but they just started to raise and i must say this token needs to be examined more closely."
1,"True. That's kinda annoying, but after listings on major exchanges they usually at least triple and you get a good compensation for all the inconveniences"
1,Was looking to buy XSPEC and TIE. Great!
1,"Ehm, well my best friend knows I'm a true friend because I stayed up all night with her last night while she puked her face off, took her home instead of letting her go with some punk, and kept rolling her onto her side so she wouldn't choke on her own goddamn puke and die.

1,"I don't think they are as much, its just easier for the vocal minority to get attention in the internet age. Most people I've met in real life couldn't give to shits about a lot of 'Offensive' stuff. "
1,Because society has taught them that Victim-hood is empowerment. 
1,"I think it's a process. 24 hour news cycle creates a demand for more newsworthy content. They inflate minor controversies to what they consider newsworthy levels. They also give voice to very small minorities who do actually feel offended, but historically would have been dismissed, rightly so, as not newsworthy. So we are much more exposed to people being offended by things, and we start to see the world in those terms. We have been trained to look for things that are ""offensive"" even if they don't actually offend us personally. We get offended on other people's behalf, which isn't always a bad thing, but it can lead to a situation where no one is genuinely offended by something but we're all acting offended so as not to seem offensive. Eventually people become hypersensitive to potentially offense causing behavior and are empowered to vocalize it.

That's not to say that there aren't offensive things out there worth speaking up about. I think our society is better when it allows people to have an open discussion about those things. There is a danger though, of raising every seeming offense to an equal level.
"
1,Time to sell.
1,What the actual fuck? This feels so wrong.
1,In my opinion this is true. I have no basis for this... but I like money.
1,"Hope so, still all HODL here. It's one of the most innovative coins out there, with a fantastic team, which seems to grow bigger everytime I blink with a new superbrain member. Too much hate on forums lately, IOTA deserves more praise and a higher price."
1,Enjoyable podcast and like the idea of spreading information about iota to podcasters. We gotta get Dominik on a better mic tho!
1,only slightly biased opinion
1,Nice to finally hear something regarding China. A step in the right direction.. I'm sure there will be more news coming soon.
1,Oh boy so bullish on Vechain!
1,Vechain!
1,"This really is fantastic news for Chinese crypto. VEN and NULS especially with their links to the government. This news should bring confidence back to Chinese investors, keep an eye out for volume heading up in Asia when the news gets out properly... we could have a nice Chinese coin pump."
1,What is this coin called and where can I throw money at it? Sounds undervalued and should be at least Tron's marketcap. 
1,Better than other projects in this field
1,The BTC ship is sinking fast.
1,"Bitcoin stopped being Bitcoin when it went all in on a idiotic ""store of value"" and downgraded the network by crippling it with something nobody wants or needs

1,"There is no bitcoin core or bitcoin main no matter how much Roger Ver reeeees.

Love how he gets triggered by people calling Bcash Bcash but he openly calls Bitcoin a name it's not.

There's no such thing as Bitcoin Core.

Bitcoin is Bitcoin. Bcash will be sold en masse by Bitcoin Hodlers. Roger Ver will get out via insider trading and everyone else will realize the scamcoin was a shitcoin all along.
"
1,"Here people are taking bitcoin wrong they just want the profit, over 90% of the people i have met who hold bitcoin doesn’t know the core technology and it’s shameful."
1,There have been a few times trading on Binance at night where I've asked siri what time it is in Mumbai.
1,It's a disruption. Happening all around the world. Old farts jobs are on the line.
1,why no RSK coin?
1,How will it effect bitcoins price and do I have to buy it?
1,Can't wait to see the first smart contract in action.
1,"A lot of us have owned bitcoin since the start. We’ve already cashed out of fiat and likely will never move that money back to fiat. We have mined and traded shitcoins to accumulate more bitcoins. Longer term the fees are high because A LOT of people use it. I can move tens of thousands of dollars worth of bitcoin for just $40-50 (and soon cheaper with LN) and I know it’s secured by the network and temper-proof math. There are lots of smart people working on bitcoin and we ll figure out the technological solutions to any problem that comes up, be it scaling or fees or anything"
1,Well done. We are proud.
1,Heck ya way to go!
1,Great! Good luck!
1,Do you have a beginners intro to TEIS?
1,Does anyone who was invested know why it fell so hard? I think that's not the guys who invested in TIES
1,Do ya know what is also working its way up the cryptocurrency ranks? TIES!
1,Better invest in TIES
1,Interesting technology. Need to invest
1,Anybody know why it’s skyrocketing ? Not that I’m complaining but would like to get an idea. Thanks.
1,Strange. A guy that works for Stellar project predicted 40 cents by end of 2017.
1,IBM is a really huge partner in crypto. FairX fiat exchange? Cmon Thats massive. P
1,Fairx.io is a BIG deal and probably game changer in 2018 . FIAT to alt is coming and it will all go through stellar backed up by IBM
1,"If you made money with TIE it would made a better money, man"
1,You should think about investing in TIE
1,"Hmm. Wanted to get in on it 2 weeks ago and didn't. Thinking of doing it again now, but I'm quite new to the scene and I don't know what to expect when it'll hit a major exchange. It could shoot up further, or a lot of people could get rid of it very quickly and it would drop down significantly, right?"
1,Wish I would have bought more 
1,"I'm losing the excitement for xrb to be listed on major exchanges. This amount of growth backed by almost no volume won't sustain, it might spike when it gets listed but I think xrb will go down below 1b once people are able to sell. "
1,"Sounds interesting, need more info"
1,I always shiver when I read these articles and they say that IOTA is a blockchain-based crypto
1,Stopped reading after he said users need REQ tokens to participate in the network
1,"They can shill it all they want, upvote it all they want, but hands down its a great coin. Great team. Great product, Great delivery on roadmap, and more to be said. I agree that I don't like shills, and I am invested in this coin, but everything about this project is good as I can see it. We have puh-lenty of coins even in the top 20 that are complete shite with no product, team unproven, and behind schedule. Investing in coins is a good idea, but investing in a team that can deliver is a better one. REQ will go places, shilled or not."

1,"Finally he shills a coin I own! Gonna hodl on to it tho, not selling for a quick buck. I think the price will stay at around 0.0000280 even after it calms down"
1,"(shrug), kind of crappy how he's been pumping coins, but I'll take a little boost at this point."
1,This is one of the best summations of Ripple’s position that I’ve read. 
1,ReddCoin up 200%﻿!
1,I had about .01 in REDD but my fucking twitter didnt send me his alert and didnt see it until it jumped to fucking 190. FUCK ME!!!! FUCK TWITTER! 
1,Well now we can confirm he’s definitely getting paid to shill these coins. Redd has been dead for a long time and it’s time to shine has come and gone. They have 1 active dev who has been delaying REDDID for over a year. Anyone who buys into this coin deserves to lose their money. 
1,"Finally, something that really is a big deal.
Wall Street buying actual BitCoin and not printing funny money from spot prices like the futures do."
1,"Dont accept bitcoin tips. As you said its gonna crash, so you better use another payment method.﻿"
1,Alright alright you got a laugh out of me at Doge coin lol﻿
1,THIS is the kind of people we need representing cryptocurrencies. Not rude and selfish people like Roger Ver.﻿
1,"Every investor should know as much as possible on his investment, and knowing enough means he is closing in on insider info. Then he must graft the regulators to keep them off his back."
1,Great. But when is it coming? A few months and Bitcoin Cash takes over as digital currency.
1,"Everything he says is a lie. bcash can't use the developments from bitcoin because it doesn't have segwit, and how is it better than litecoin, bcash is just a clone of an old version of bitcoin without all the updates. It is a cheap imitation pushed by scammers like Roger Ver. The only difference with bcash and the old version of bitcoin is that bcash changed a parameter that will make it worse for the future, while bitcoin unlike bcash will be able to scale with lightning network.﻿"
1,"If you invest in it A LOT, you're gonna say such things A LOT"

1,"Simple truth, but many people still don't understand it. 

If you want to start investing in crypto, use the following strategy. Buy some major tokens costing not much, Ripple is best suited. Then you can choose token that is actively shilled on crypto forums, for example, RaiBlocks or Enigma. And you definitely should add one unpopular token offered by platform providing useful service like TIES or Primas.    

Don't spend much money on tokens. Buy 3-6 tokens and monitor dynamics of the market. It is helping to define whether you can succeed in crypto world or not. "

1,But why? I think Bernie is for the poor and the oppressed. 
1,"All religions should penetrate each other making itself and the other one better - softer and kinder, and easiest way to achieve it is by means of our kids because they are more open to anything new and yet spoiled with all those biases we adults are overloaded with.   "
1,Well Rome was not built in a day so they need some time too to fix the problem besides this migrant crisis is much harder to solve than to build Rome anew. 
1,They are afraid to be deported by Trump anyway. 
1,And if Bernie Sanders? 
1,If Merkel cannot fix this problem so nobody else of present German politicians will be capable enough to fix it either. 
1,"You see there is always some trivial punchline of a joke and some extended version of it so in the case of this two fishermen I like the extended more sophisticated punchline of it more.  

"
1,They were kind fishermen really. 
1,Better version indeed. 
1,Thanks I'll try for certain. 
1,Thanks I've never tasted it in this way so let me try. 
1,Sooner or later all countries are going to change but it's good if it happens smoothly and gradually so to say evolutionary but here it seems to be a revolution instead. 
1,The French have gotten so relaxed that they have dismissed most of their intelligence service agents so now they can hardly undertake any anti-terrorist preventive measures.   
1,I guess you are right and what American breweries can you recommend personally? 
1,Funny too but I've heard the second version too. 
1,"Why, really clever but those men were fishers but hucksters. "
1,Well they created mermaid like a female but only half - and why? 
1,"You know I agree with ""philosophical pondering"" remark from the previous comment because the fishermen's question seems rather ""how could I have..."" than your version. 
"
1,Oh those cunning Gods... 
1,just Belle Époque really 
1,It's not equal losses - just Turkish tourism vs huge Russian gas projects in my opinion. 
1,It seems a very old joke because they didn't even think about one more way quite evident nowadays.  
1,For me it's more about practical wits of the first fisherman than all the rest.  
1,Well they shot down a Russian plane so after that accident surely Russians will be more suspicious about going to Turkey to have vocations moreover it can be prohibited by their government completely I guess.   
1,Well agree and Russia and Turkey are on the same side in the region to shoot down planes of each other besides to down a plane is a minor thing but to kill military pilots is just a military crime I think. 
1,Or you'll find someone with whom you'll want them too - only love can solve such problems according to my own experience.  
1,"""Also parents, how did you know when you wanted kids?"" - I always wanted to have a good family with kids and I was married thrice but only my last marriage when I met a girl whom I loved like crazy made me happy and just then I felt exactly ready for kids - to love them, to work for them, to raise them in love and happiness. But I've got a boy of my second marriage too and it occurred I didn't love my second wife so somehow I couldn't love my son either; finally we divorced and now I help them and meet my son regularly but yet there is no much love for him in my heart anyway especially in comparison to my younger daughter of my last beloved marriage. "
1,"Well on the other hand Turks themselves have bombed mostly Kurds in Syria while this conflict but not ISIS targets, haven't they? So we can expect Russians in the guise of Syrians of course will shoot down a couple of their jets on a mission too.  "
1,I think you are right except civilians with arms cannot already be called pure civilians so I guess militants kill militants and the problem of this incident is that Russian jet was shot by Turkey which would-be    a so-called anti-ISIS coalition member too and now it's unclear who is fighting whom over there at the moment. 
1,"That's the point - ""reportedly"". "
1,In this case we are all quite lucky it was a Russian jet shot down by Turks because today any local nuclear conflicts are just impossible without spreading worldwide sooner or later. 
1,I think in the case of another war on the Soviet Union in 1945 Poland could have become extinct altogether so they were quite lucky then neither Roosevelt nor Churchill started it. 
1,Very sarcastic but exactly correct and it's seems normal concerning Turkish-Russian relationship - first Russia accuses Turkey in that infamous Armenian genocide making them quite unfriendly but then Putin offers Erdogan that gas project just like they are close friends really. 
1,Partly right and surely NATO will buck up its ally Turkey but sooner or later either anti-ISIS alliance or Russia or they together will destroy oil facilities of ISIS in Syria on the other hand Putin will suspend that gas project with Turks so it'll be the double loss for them and Erdogan will have to deal with it this way or another.  
1,But now it has happened and Erdogan seems to keep silence concerning the accident and I think so makes the relationship with Russia worse although first of all it's his task to clarify the issue and make friends with Putin again.  
1,Well I think at the moment no military official can independently order to shoot down a Russian aircraft without the president confirmation because in the worst case it can mean a war and now I guess nobody wants a military conflict with Russia or China. 
1,Really I cannot understand how altogether Erdogan could bring himself to shoot down that Russian jet just after so many peaceful and economic talks with Putin recently about all those great gas-oil projects potentially coming soon. I think Russia will answer to it correspondingly.

So-called ""specialists"" and many investors, especially the ones who organized 2008 financial crisis, are screaming that our world faces ""bubble"", and cryptos cost nothing. These crooks just stop technological advancement. Many platforms that offer not just their coins, but also useful services. I continue hodling and even buy some more tokens, for example, have recently bought Enigma and TIES.  "

While new platforms like Stellar or Ties (it's not that popular, that's why you have to check it out) emerge, Ethereum still remains no.1 for people creating dapps. It's beyond the bounds of possibility to say for sure whether other platforms will overcome Ethereum or not.

1,"I see your point, OK but I take the present majority of the local people and I don't find it's quite correct to use digits of the past concerning this matter. "
1,Agree completely and support your opinion absolutely besides I don't think it's bad if Muslim children can just listen to our carols sitting in the hall and vise versa Christian children can visit some Muslim festivals in the same school concert hall. And only like this we can create true religiously tolerant society but not banning these or those holidays.   
1,"No, I don't think so especially when a religious practice has gone into a certain cultural traditions long ago. Well it's OK for me to go into a church of any confession to pray and to burn a candle and I don't think I betray my original faith.   "
1,Exactly! 
1,I think that's too far. 
1,Christmas is a great cultural tradition worthy to stay untouched forever in any Christian country like Italy or France because I think strange people should adjust to the local culture but not vice versa.

Maybe husband and wife are both into BDSM, but the judge can be sure that it is domestic violence. Should be couple jailed if the law says that acts affecting body is a crime? Mutual agreement is very important point!

P.S.  According to a 1998 study of college students who experienced sexual relationships with an adult while still a minor found that the adolescent was not harmed by mutually consensual sexual experiences. When harm was discovered the harm came from the adolescent's dysfunctional family of origin not from the sexual relationship with the adult. The study also included a statistical study of thousand of older record of alleged adolescent sexual abuse by an adult and found the same relation between mutually agreed upon sex between the adolescent and an adult did not cause any emotional harm. Where harm was found the statistical analysis shows the harm predated the sexual relationship and was the results of a dysfunctional family of origin not the sexual relationship.

1,"Not sure, [but maybe so](http://nicolaiannazzo.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/satan-statue-oklahoma-2.jpg)?"
1,I think she had sexual contact with her student during off-duty hours
1,"I say about mutual agreement where there is no violence. Moreover, we should listen what a victim says. Maybe husband and wife are both into BDSM, but the judge can be sure that it is domestic violence. Should be couple jailed if the law says that acts affecting body is a crime? Mutual agreement is very important point!

P.S.  According to a 1998 study of college students who experienced sexual relationships with an adult while still a minor found that the adolescent was not harmed by mutually consensual sexual experiences. When harm was discovered the harm came from the adolescent's dysfunctional family of origin not from the sexual relationship with the adult. The study also included a statistical study of thousand of older record of alleged adolescent sexual abuse by an adult and found the same relation between mutually agreed upon sex between the adolescent and an adult did not cause any emotional harm. Where harm was found the statistical analysis shows the harm predated the sexual relationship and was the results of a dysfunctional family of origin not the sexual relationship.

1,"But nobody bans to use Nazi flag, right?"
1,"Well, it's a crime, but students wanted have a sex, there is no doubt. They did their students worse, they didn't abuse their students. Be sure, students were happy to fuck their teacher. 22 years imprisonment is too much..."

1,Doesn't seem realistic at all. They just want to show industry awareness.
1,The government will most likely not adopt an existing crypto currency and use their own one which they can control. The government is not going to use a currency that they have no control over.

1,"Should I sell my xlm bags for a 8% loss and move into either AMB, TIE, or WTC after the price corrects?"
1,"
Everytime on an exchange I'm like Let's see some walls fall down. Everytime it's happen to be the wrong wall.

Thought about taking some of my LTC and moving into IOTA, TIE and Ripple since I'm quite convinced about their projects."
1,"Well I ripped off the bandaid. Sold everything into BTC except TIE and NEO. And ENJ because that's so low I can't even meet the minimum on Binance & Tidex.

Most sold for what I paid or a loss. Yes, I locked in a loss because I think BTC will go up today while alts stagnate, and I can buy them again on the dip and have a lower basis. I was in 15 different alts and needed to consolidate anyway.
"
1,Should I put my $50 (big money I know) into TIE or NANO? I own 20 of each as of right now. 
1,"Is OMG a good buy? I have a bit of LTC, TIE, and ETH just rotting in bitfinex, and I figured I might as well diversify it with whatever else is on that exchange."

1,"Wow, bitcoin? They should have at least mined iExec RLC, SONM, GOLEM, Hadron or something using idle computing to pretend that they are doing it for the good of humanity and promoting research by utilizing idle time."
1,When you go to work and all you can think of is Bitcoin.
1,It's unbelievable that years ago I would be excited to hear one tiny peep about bitcoin even on TV or the news... Now we have Russian nuclear scientists literally being arrested while trying to mine with government supercomputers! I fucking love it! Is this the only time line or did we somehow manage a quantum jump to the best one? Life is amazing.
1,Invested in 1 and 3 long ago. Thoughts? Recommendations? Anything haha
1,Anyone have any reservations about the spamming network answer? Not the most reassuring answer.
1,I like the small part where he says vendors are coming to them because of the zero fees. This is how adoption starts.

1,Nice job Pearl team. I'm expecting big things from you guys this year!
1,Don't believe everything you read on the internet kids.

1,I'm downloading this shit son
1,This is fantastic partnership. The future of finance is emerging.
1,They’re talking about protecting people from the scam coins. Doesn’t mean they won’t support the official coins 
1,I think at some level this makes sense. Who the hell is investing in crypto based on a facebook ad? Probably idiots. Whos going to advertise to these idiots? Scams like Bitconnect. 
1,"If you actually read the terms and conditions it makes perfect sense why he is banning ICO ads and get rich on bitcoin ads. ICOs that gain popularity from Facebook ads are total cancer anyway, we haven’t lost anything.

He’s also banning binary trading ads which is also a terrible form of gambling.
"
1,Zuckerburg isn’t doing this to protect people. He’s doing it because they have dreamed up a strategy to make money. Facebook crypto in the pipeline. Banning crypto adverts now eliminates future competition for Facebook coin under the pretence of ‘helping all those poor stupid people’. I despise everything Facebook stands for. 
1,Interesting move by VeChain. I wonder if its related to the MSU rumor?
1,What a glorious day for Vechain ... and therefore the world.

1,Iota is perfect for this job! Great team up for both sides.
1,If we go to $10 I'm renting a penthouse in Taipei and throwing an IOTA hodlers super party. 
1,"IOTA is LEGIT for many reasons. Yes, there is annoying wallet which now works perfectly fine and there is no danger in using it. So don't be afraid - the wallet is okey. Just remember to generate seed in KeePass and change few letters.

1) IOTA has the huge team - a lot of people are now working with iota foundation and lead developer is Come from beyond - inventor of proof of stake.

2) Partnerships - BOSCH bought a lot of IOTA. Volkswagen has a person in IOTA foundation. A huge amount of participants in DATA marketplace. TOKYO partnership, now Taipei partnership and a LOT of smaller projects. Even Oyster pearl - a favourite here- is made on IOTA tangle.

3) Follow the progress - if you watch closely there is so much going on with IOTA - IOTA foundation is doing so much atm. There are third parties working on IOTA as well - for example, ROMAN SEMKO - check him out.

1,It must be safest platform than others like this.
1,Any thoughts on this? Pretty interesting project smh
1,"Yea, whatever you do, do not open a Robinhood account without a referral. You get a free stock when you open through a referral. "
1,Why is this coin not mooning? Robinhood is very popular. Is cobinhood from the same people?
1,Just so we're clear here: Robinhood has nothing to do with Cobinhood. It confused me at first too. Robinhood actually issued a cease and desist to Cobinhood about the name awhile back. 
1,"THIS IS FUCKING HUGE. This finally brings crypto to the mainstream. No more sketchy exchanges where transactions aren't made on time, we'll have much better transparency and audits now. Coinbase, up your game cause Robinhood is going to eat your breakfast, lunch, and dinner."
1,"I really hope this makes coinbase nervous and coinbase starts to add more cryptos. This is the best part of capitalism, and no one ever thanks it or sees it for it's glory. Let's go coinhood! Hurry it up in all of the states!"
1,"This is huge. I wonder if you'll be able to send crypto to and from your Robinhood account, or if you'll only be able to buy and sell through the app."
1,What does this mean for FairX?
1,Coinbase will have to make a lot of changes to keep up. I predict a removal of fees and addition of a lot of coins to try and out pace Robinhood.
1,"The Article says trading Bitcoin and Ethereum will be commission free in February, with other Altcoins coming in the following months. "

1,What's the challenge with sequencing DNA? We've been doing it for a while. There must be additional hurdles the data scientist created.
1,Why do people consistently post bitcoin.com and upvote it to hot. People never learn.
1,"I don't get it anymore. China/South Korea are banning crypto. Just kidding, banks are ready to provide service. Jk again, we're banning. Almost ready to provide service. Every time I hear a ""ban"", I just pretend they mean it's a ban for 1 week. "
1,"This is certainly a change of tone - a few banks have been blocking transfers while South Korean government is publicly saying that 6 banks will be prepared to service cryptocurrency exchanges this month.

I can see South Korea becoming the new Japan for cryptocurrencies once they iron out the edges.

Congratulations to those who survived the dip!

1,I wonder who is doing the prove of work. 
1,"Which Blockchain are they using? If it's a centralized one, then there's really no point in using it, since one central blockchain can be tampered with."
1,"Is it really a surprise that people were manipulating crypto?

That line is a long, long queue."
1,"Selling off before announcing a regulation is market manipulation? It's definitely insider trading ( crypto is unregulated so...) but it only represents them jumping off a sinking ship, not buying dips."
1,"This is an UNREGULATED market. I thought that's what you all wanted? Separation from government and taking power back?

There are regulations in place for a reason."
1,People need to learn. Never trust the government. They are all out to scam and make money. Politicians will alway be the biggest crooks. Any negative information that comes from any government agency is all FUD (someone on the inside is benefiting). Why do we not realize this? Happens over and over and over throughout history. Get with the program.
1,"1) Dump coins at massive profit 2) Announce ban 3) Buy back on the cheap 4) Announce that there isn't a ban 5) $$$$$$

Fuckers."
1,"No shit, we've been saying this the entire time. China and Korea can manipulate the markets with a simple statement, of course they're exploiting it."
1,The whole South Korea FUD is very suspicious. The false news being broadcast by that CNBC writer and btc price dipping to futures contract prices and slowly recovering straight after they expired. It’s too much of a coincidence for it to happen all at the same time in my opinion.
1,they spread fud to buy cheap themselves rofl.
1,Delta app is nice but it should be able to connect to exchanges and get your data automatically. Manually inputting your trades gets really tedious
1,It's days like today that I am glad I went all in on USDT.

Fake news they cant stop crypto anyway
"
1,"So this is a comment of a minister saying they want to pass a law banning crypto trading, which would have to go to a vote and could take months or years to pass, if it ever does?

If I didn't know better I though governments are playing with the market to try to crash crypto prices.
"
1,"Oh fuck, here go. China FUD 2.0."
1,"We shouldn't overreact until we actually see the draft legislation. And even then we should wait until there is an actual vote (if it gets that far).

1,Yeah time for me to abandon that ship.

1,Facebook login on coinbase
1,"Pretty significant to be honest. Whichever crypto they will use, will get a massive influx of users. Probably a good idea to keep an eye on what they will integrate."
1,"If anything they will make their own and call it FaceChain, BlockFace, BlockBook, FaceBlock, FaceChain, CryptoBook, or maybe CryptoFace"
1,Finally!
1,Good news!
1,So this would be like a DAPP developed on ethereum correct? I don't see any mention of ARK on their website though
1,"This is comparable with using a Facebook login nowadays, but then without sharing your information with a third party?"

1,"The volume is really low for its market cap.

It will be interesting when it hits a big legitimate exchange. Will the demand skyrocket or will people sitting on them look to cash out. Or both?"
1,At what point does it become concerning? Continued exponential growth isn't always good
1,15000% in a month. I should have bought much more when i did.
1,"Blockchain is everywhere. In future, it will be impossible to take a shit without using this technology."
1,750% more is still coming next year. The coin is only two unknown exchanges and is still generating a lot of volume and growth
1,The lack of any of big exchanges keeps me away from this one. I don't know exactly why but we'll see if I ultimately regret this.
1,DAG wallets are hard to set up apparently. Thus why you can only buy IOTA on a few exchanges.
1,When will this price increase chill?? Trying to find a good entry point
1,"Yay more recognition for NAV! Great team, great coin, way under the radar for far too long considering how much it does already and how much more is shortly to come..."
1,Price is skyrocketing!!
1,Ok - I don't get it. So this is like Ripple XRP in that its for transferring currency between two people except REQ is dependant/based on Ethereum? Is that a good summary?
1,"I hold REQ as ~15-20% of my cryptos but I'm thinking of reconsidering now, or at least just viewing it as a short-term investment.

Can someone explain to me why we need/want a blockchain in a ""PayPal"" like application? Think about the transactions you use PayPal for - small online businesses, maybe paying for something from Craigslist, etc. Would you feel comfortable making these purchases if the transaction was irreversible? I know I typically wouldn't.

PayPal sucks for merchants, yet it's still widely accepted because consumers love the protection it gives them. Consumers drive adoption of these payment systems. Consumers are not going to use a payment system that's irreversible.

So how is REQ going to succeed being ""the next Paypal"" by using a blockchain? Why not build all the great stuff they're planning on building without a blockchain?"

1,"Can you add a search function to filter coins by their abbreviations? For example, if you were to add a chart for Litecoin you could simply enter ""LTC"" instead of having to type the full name. I believe a lot of people would appreciate such a feature."
1,"Any way to have multiple exchanges listed within same chart? I was planning on building it in Jan.

Have the 4-5 exchanges alll for BTC/USD and such so it makes it easier to get the best prices for dips and pumps from each place at once."
1,"alright..i quicky got into it. Any way to have coins we are following in one chart? Or does that bonk things up? Instead of having just a huge bitcoin chart that is hard to scale, perhaps smaller ones that follow what coin we add.. I suppose thats hard to do because youve gotta link to binance or something.

Seems rather raw but looking good !"
1,There will be a 1000 competing cryptos by the end of 2018 to be honest..

1,"100 billion USD left the crypto markets in the last 24 hours. What we are seeing is institutional investors and super rich bastards locking in long term capital gains before the end of the calendar year.

we may not see a symmetrical recovery after this and my guess is not every crypto is going to rebound the same. these investors will re evaluate their allocations and buy those cryptos that make the most sense

P.S.

Where harm was found the statistical analysis shows the harm predated the sexual relationship and was the results of a dysfunctional family of origin not the sexual relationship.

There's segregation and ostracism when it comes to Blacks and Whites, even though now it's a bit reduced because of civilization. BUT WHITE PRIVILEGE DOES EXIST> "
1,"No, it isn't. It's a serious movement with a history and the revolution of Black Freedom. Sometimes, hard measures should be put in place to get what one deserve. And besides, Blacks were not brought up with ""White Privilege""."

1,"Then I guess you're rich then. I think if he is vicious, he wouldn't remain broke but if he's shortsighted, you shouldn't even try because both of you will become broke at the end of the day."

1,I don't think the NY Times would write an article based on false assumptions.
1,This confirms all the bad things people say about big-city cops if not all police departments.
1,I agree with you. We have a lot of issues with governance now but to have a careless and an irresponsible leader is not the way forward.
1,may I ask why?
1,"yeah, that awful feeling of considering yourself as a racist...
Until we stop to use white and black, African American or White American, Latino or Assian American, we are daily dealing building a culture which is racially directed. Let's refer to people by their names and not by their skin color. "
1,"Sometimes, we can act this way mistakenly towards another person and not realize it. But we shouldn't repeat it and it's even better to apologize to that person."
1,"Well, responding to a person because of his attitude towards you or another person no matter what skin color the person has doesn't in any way make you racist. "
1,What the fuck do you mean by that?
1,"stereotyping, and intentional acts of discrimination towards another race."
1,For a cop to meet me out there and shoot me because I'm a Black American. Things these racist cops do now scares me.
1,"really? You know him? When they wear the uniform, they think they are above the law."
1,Cats are very smart creatures. They so much trust their instinct such that they thought they could catch the laser :D
1,Did the sink also grow up? Just wondering because it looks like the same setting.

1,I fell in love with this post and had to repost it :)
1,"Cats are actually revered in Islam. This Imam is just adoring these cats and caring for them... awwww :-)
There is a story about how Mohammed went without a coat once because a cat was sleeping on it."
1,"loyalty is to the highest authority, so if the fellow cop or superior doesn't do anything about it he should report to a higher authority until justice is met... Not relenting or resting to fight for the common person. That's what his job is about, defending the weak and the poor is morally right and their duty as well."
1,"Of course, what he did compared to those cops who killed innocent people and walked free is nothin... lolz"
1,Of course they are not good cops and that's what the video condemns. They think that not being involved in brutal acts make them good or innocent.
1,I only hope it's true as you say. He has a strong character but he need to give us more reasons to vote him into power.
1,This video is his evidence and he gave out the same to protect himself from being brutalized. They should file a case against the cop for threatening them with his badge and gun.
1,"Thanks for your comment. I like the part that you said that if Bernie was born in Europe, he would have been much happier... lolz"
1,"that's a bit hilarious, don't you think so?"
1,Thanks for sharing your thoughts. Do you think that Obama has changed America for the best as he promised in the 2008 campaigns?
1,"they are trained to do the officers' bidding. In this case, the officers probably asked them to eat the man up :-("
1,"This is not a racist post. The news is in honor of a teenager whose sophomore’s work was voted as a National Winner out of a 100,000 artworks. I thought it was worth sharing and also to create an awareness that blacks are not related to thug-life or drugs, as most people imagine. But are vitally involved in artistic work and things that promote nation building."
1,Exactly digbus*... that would be unbelievable :D
1,"I guess the picture speaks for itself...
As to whether they are unfunny, the same blood runs through them...lolz"
1,"Well, that still does not give the cop the right to hit him with his car. What if he went into shock or died as a result of that? The measures the police use in arresting people are uncalled for these days. Something should be done about it."
1,What in the article confused you? The article is only a reported fact of what happened to this poor Black girl because of her hair.
1,grey and cold :-(
1,beautiful :)
1,good observation!
1,"maybe he saw something that he wasn't supposed to see :D

1,Definitely right! But I love his chronology :)
1,"I think this is cool :)
Nuclear power should be used for innovation and good things not for killing ourselves."
1,Fucked!:D
1,lolz... seems like we've been in the same shoes :D
1,All these huge settlements from the Tax payers money could be used to fund something useful or increase the minimum wage of every worker. Then with stricter judgement put every cop that abuses his power or brutalizes any citizen or suspect put in dark holes where they will never see the light till they die.
1,"Hell no!!! What did he do to determine this kind of arrest?
""F**k Tha Police"". They should all rot in hell if not convicted on earth  I really feel for this guy. :-("
1,"This is bullshit! Until the justice system becomes just, we're going to experience overwhelming chaos in our cities. #Standupforthetruth "
1,you're right. The system is corrupt and not dependable. We have to learn how to defend ourselves and get to know the law for ourselves. I realized that Cops are afraid of lawyers.
1,this police brutality shit must stop! People should have and enjoy the life they have not living in fear everyday.
1,"you're right, knowing the law for yourself will do you a lot of good."
1,Netflix (White pussy) didn't like the way the kiss ended :D lolz

1,"Good job Mohammed, we need more compassionate citizens who will care about the cry of others."
1,"Well, it's a decision he had to make after a careful thought and he chose his son over the cash. Come to think of it, he could have heeded to them and agreed to bring his son and wife around from time to time. So that he can still get paid as he supplies his family. Also, I think the media is shocked with the rejection of the money than him  not compromising his family."

1,"It's just a corrupted system with fallen laws and executions.
if gays are allowed by the law to be together and prostitutes licensed, why should he be prosecuted for paying for sex so long as his fight against them haven't be accepted? lol "

Words 'Respecting the heritage and rights of European Americans' is exactly the proof of his racism. His only heritage is a 'white party hat' in his closet."

Be real. This is not a one on one affair. there were cops. not a cop. warnings made to a madman to stop running? that man could have been kicked once in the face and that was all. Did the mad man run towards people on the streets to kill them? Ha its funny when you talk like that rewatch the video again man. Atleaaaast a shot in the leg!!!!! common u want me to believe that running guy was in a kill chase? sometimes you know we gotta be real. For me that killing was so uncalled for. And its wrong to defend them thinking about them risking their lives. And u never know what choices iv got to make so dont even mention yh :) And you even have no idea who i am so dont take this personal. I dont need to apply for a job as a cop to voice my views tho. I said what i think and saw from the video.

u trying to say cops arent trained enough for that. Than man had no weapon for christ sake and there were more than one cop. i saw so many videos of how cops in other states deal with mad people. Taking someone's life really isn't and shouldn't be an option for cops unless there is really the need to. Its just like an ordinary man putting on the uniform, grabs 1 or 2 weapons/tools and goes out there to protect citizens. Cops are and should be trained get that point please. they could have done pretty much better trust me. Its so sad we dont understand such cases because these victims are no relatives to us. Maybe we would be understanding then."

1," 1. Start Small - Start with something you can do immediately and easily. When we start with small successes, we build momentum to gain more confidence in our abilities.
2. Create a Compelling Vision - Use the power of your imagination. Create an image of yourself as the confident and self-assured person you aspire to become. 
3. Socialize - Get out of the house or setup a lunch date with a friend. Socializing with others will give us opportunities to connect with other people, and practice our communication and interpersonal skills. 
4. Do Something that Scares You - As with all skills, we get better with practice and repetition. The more often we proactively do things that scare us, the less scary these situations will seem, and eventually will be rid of that fear.
5. Do Something You Are Good At - What are you especially good at or enjoy doing? Regularly doing things that you are good at reinforces your belief in your abilities and strengths. I (Tina) can be very efficient with completing errands or administrative work.
6. Set Goals - According to a study done at Virginia Tech, 80% of Americans say they don’t have goals. And the people who regularly write down their goals earn nine times as much over their lifetime as people who don’t.
7. Help Others Feel Good About Themselves - Help somebody or teach them something. When you help other people feel better about themselves and like themselves more, it will make you feel good about yourself. 
8. Get Clarity on Life Areas - Get clarity on the life area that needs the most attention. Your self-esteem is the average of your self-concept in all the major areas of your life. Write down all the major categories of your life, e.g., health, relationships, finance, etc. 
9. Create a Plan - Having a goal alone won’t do much. Get clarity on your action items. One of the biggest reasons people get lazy is because they don’t have a plan to achieve their goals. 
10. Get Motivated - Read something inspirational, listen to something empowering, talk to someone who can uplift our spirits, who can motivate us to become a better person, to live more consciously, and to take proactive steps towards creating a better life for ourselves and our families.
11. Get External Compliments - As funny as this point suggests, go find a friend or family member and ask them “What do you like about me?” “What are my strengths?” or “What do you love about me?” We will often value other people’s opinions more than our own.
12. Affirmations & Introspection - Use affirmations, but in the right way. Some people think that when they’re in a slump, using positive affirmations will help them get out of it. I love affirmations, but I’ve realized you have to use them in the right way. 
13. No More Comparisons - Stop comparing yourself to other people. Low-self esteem stems from the feeling of being inferior. For example, if you were the only person in the world, do you think you could have low-self esteem? Self-esteem only comes into the picture when there are other people around us and we perceive that we are inferior.  "

It's like a timer you set to perform duties you find hard to make yourself finish; basically it divides one giant task into a set of smaller, time-limited tasks and I've found it extremely helpful!

1,government is ready to spend millions of $ to welcome refugees when American citizens can't even afford electricity

1,"I believe that a genius definitely can be made. Of course, if we are talking not about Albert Einstein or Nikola Tesla, Or Mozart; but about someone like Henry Ford, Alan Rickman or Colonel Sanders :D 
I mean, to reach the level of Newton or Maxwell you probably would have to dedicate your entire life to a very specific area of expertise, but late blooming entrepreneurs are not uncommon. 
I believe that as soon as one finds his niche, where he/she could develop both their personality and skills and maybe become an ace in that niche, then it doesn't matter how old is the person.
The most important thing is to understand what you really like, what interests you the most and try to find out how you can turn it into a profitable life goal... 
You have plenty of time, do what you enjoy, and who knows, one day you can really end up with two PhD's :D"
1,Don't stress out. You said that you feel that this job is not where you belong; have you closed any deals since applying? How did you feel at that time?
1,Might it be depression or chronic fatigue syndrome?
1,"I believe it's a pretty valuable experience. Someone who used to work in retail/fast food will never be the same again in terms of verbal abuse, ignorance, ego-centrism and condescension.

1,"Hillary is 68, she just can't be all healthy"
1,that's what you call politeness!
1,"This is understandable: there are too many Hillary investigations, they just can't handle them all at the same time."

1,that's great that they try to involve people into science

1,That's right. Is there any problem with that?
1,"Sure, you're right on this"
1,"Okay. Does it count that I've started a sentence with ""I believe"" clause?... Which presumes that I may not express the views of everyone, just my own?..."
1,"Erm, no, that was supposed to be a reply to someone in the thread who suggested me raise the child as an opposite gender, as we're speaking here generally"
1,"You see, my point here is that a person need to know and understand the concept of gender rather than thinking that every person is genderless. So could you please tell me how your vision of gender insignificance correlates with my original post?..."
1,I suppose you can effectively begin a new thread here on CMV
1,"You have a point! Thanks, I'll definitely try to make use of used supplies and try to adjust my budget"
1,"You're right, ""it"" was an inappropriate pronoun, sorry.
Regarding your point: wouldn't it be absolutely useless, first tricking a child into thinking that a gender as a fact does not exist and does not define the kid in any way, only to find out later that people in the world, in fact, are divided by some certain attributes. Wouldn't that be traumatizing for the child?"
1,"I get your point. Added an edit to the post
"
1,Thank you! You took the words from my mouth
1,">>  you do not need to go from zero preperation to fully prepped for the end of the world all at once. Its a lifelong process. 
Thank you! Very wise words. I'll try to do my best!"
1,"I think your thought is very rational and has a valid point: the child needs to have an opportunity to make his own choices, and no parent should impose anything they feel appropriate only because of parent's beliefs.
Here's a delta for you (&#8710;)
hope I did it right"
1,"I might need an update: I absolutely approve gender-neutral way of raising children; I don't believe that a moment a woman delivers someone with vagina/penis she shall immediately equip this kid with sex-appropriate items, such as blue/red attire, doll/car for a toy etc. 
What I really wanted to accentuate that some parents needlessly enforce genderless rhetoric by denying to tell anyone including the baby their real gender and letting the kid to choose who he wants to become or something similar, because I doubt that such methods will benefit the kid."
1,"Well, regarding choosing *a* gender vs choosing *no* gender: it maybe is a habit: I was raised knowing that there are two types of people - boys and girls - and now I may have difficulties addressing someone as genderless by default, because my views are already developed"
1,Agree on this
1,"That is a good point. However, I've never thought that families, which avoid labeling (like in examples you provided) really saw it through a genderless prism... but in this case I suppose you're right, this is an example I'd like to follow"
1,"Well, I personally may have not experienced much of gender discrimination while growing up, so I assume that any family with a healthy, loving environment is able to raise a child without actively trying to impose a genderless atmosphere"

1,"Their protective attitude towards co-police workers makes the whole thing insane. They have to accept the fact that the cop is not always right and that intensive investigation about each case shouldn't be on the victim but on the cop as well. If for example, there is no video from the cop's body cam and or no audio to tell us what each of them said, the cop should be blamed for that... It's a felony for trying to cover up witness on a crime scene."
1,"What if a little brother or sister of a terrorist, after seeing the open fire of his own blood, motivates him or her to revenge in the same manner years after?"

Then all terrorists would disguise themselves as wolves in sheep clothing. Something makes me wonder if they will denounce their faith because that is their inspiration."
1,Could you expound on his idea for us?

As always, I keep my calm nature especially when dealing with NYPD or any law enforcement for that matter. I was so amazed he pulled me over in that way, just because I had a GoPro. There is no law in New York State banning GoPros while on a vehicle. So I really had no clue when I was being pulled over.""
The best way to treat an ignorant cop who thinks he's the law. Keep your calm and show him he knows nothin'
"
1,"> It seems more like another example of an emboldened officer believing he is the law, or that anything he utters instantly becomes law by virtue of him speaking it aloud.

This might also be true since they are eluded by their uniform or their badge. It's insane for them to think like that. No one is above the law. Not even the makers. That's why it's called LAW!"
1,"Come on, the way and manner in which cops arrest their suspects with so much force even when they are not resisting arrest. I stand with him because until found guilty, they are innocent and should be treated with some human dignity.  "
1,"Of course) Some guys can be emotional but not very often. However, girls are most of the time be insecure especially when they have no clue what's on their guy's mind."
1,"Sometimes, I wonder if they even know the law themselves. F*cking ignorant pigs."
1,I think it depends on the kind of prank too. What if the cop made you angry and asked you to sign some crime documents you didn't commit? And later said it was a test to see how people would react.
1,"“Blue Lives Matter Act, H.R. 4760, would make “an attack on a police officer a hate crime,” according to the bill’s text. The name of the legislation, filed Wednesday, alludes to the “Black Lives Matter” mantra taken up by activists who protest police violence against black people, particularly the killings of unarmed black people at the hands of police.” What do you think about this?"
1,"The cop of course and tried to get him mad but he was in composure. If you fuck with the police, you'll only be pregnant in jail."
1,"yeah, really cute)) When your partner gets interested in something good, it's only wise and affectionate to support him or her."

1,"The media focusing on it just amplifies what already exist and is going on. If these brutal acts of the police are not curbed, who can be safe in this country? Especially when most of the cops involved in such acts are not convicted and apprehended but given administrative leave with pay which make it even more lucrative and attractive for other good cops, if they still exist."

1,"""One major question is whether Kozinski’s opinion—which takes the laudable if unusual step of identifying misbehaving members of the prosecutor’s office by name—will inspire other judges to follow suit. And, more generally, will courts recognize what Kozinski expressed about prosecutorial suppression of exculpatory evidence in his now-famous dissent in Olsen in late 2013: “Only judges can put a stop to it.” Or, will the status quo—in which judges are “strangely reluctant” to call out prosecutors let alone hold their convictions to account—continue to prevail?""

1,"This whole ""paid administrative leave"" thing has to stop.

If the investigation finds there is insufficient evidence for criminal proceedings, or the Officer is found not guilty as a result of the proceedings they should receive retroactive back pay for the time they were suspended. Our tax dollars are already being spent paying for these asshole's legal defense, we should not be required to pay their wages as well."
1,"In this case, the evidence is clear that the Officer drove carelessly and didn't allow the teacher to pass while it was green for him to cross. Unfortunate for the NYPD, they can't destroy any evidence like they fucking do (http://imgur.com/gallery/e2xXMGS). There are a lot of witnesses and this video says it all.

1,HOLY FUCK this plus gsachs exchange
1,This is great news for everyone since everything is in red.
1,I miss back in the day (like 2 weeks ago) when legitimately great news for crypto currency like this would actually be taken into consideration for the market prices.
1,"Looking at the Stone Age like operation of MUFG, you probably have to fax in your buy orders"
1,All big financial companies are have people working on blockchain. The tech is great. But it doesn't mean that we're not in a massive bubble. Only time will tell.
1,"Some people loose money, some people make it. If you lost money, it was completely your fault. 

It's just the way life works."
1,"Looks like fake news. 

I cannot believe that the bank that has occupied Cabinet of Trump really likes crypto and ideas underlying it. "
1,"It's funny to read the Warren Buffett quote since Warren Buffett, mildly speaking, is not a big fan of crypto  "
1,"Crypto is definitely an effective means to gain money, but you have to be more patient than Zen buddhists.  "
1,"Frankly speaking, it would be insane if South Korea really banned crypto trading. It's impossibe for the country that positions itself as one of the most technologically advanced countries in the world. "
1,"Thanks, mate!"
1,I know that CVC and VTC are listed on Poloniex. I wonder where can I buy Ties
1,There is no bitcoin core or bitcoin main no matter how much Roger Ver reeeees.
1,"I wrote him an email and told him ""It's megabyte, NOT megabit!"""
1,"I can't stop watching that part 3:38 ""Yeah, that was his answer. And scarily, he did not appear to be massively intoxicated""."
1,If you aren’t trolling and actually think Buffett has any interest in crypto you’re either A. A moron or B. Know nothing about Buffett. 
1,"Guys... He's referring to the overall state of crypto at the moment... Surely some of the ""currencies"" will live on."
1,"Say what you will, this man knows his shit.

All he says is...

He thinks it will end badly. He isn't involved in it. He doesn't want to be involved in something he knows nothing about.

Its just his gut feeling.

1,"Warren is a legend. Out of the 1K+ coins out there, only those with real world applications will survive. Ripple will be one of them. "
1,"Centralized or decentralized doesn't make a difference. Every company in the world knows that their long term success relies on diversification. When you look at the possibility of Coinbase adding XRP, it just makes sense. There is no downside for them. It may not be the next coin added, which would be surprising, but it will get there. It certainly helps that Coinsquare announced the addition of XRP."
1,Coinbase/GDAX would be a great thing. A lot of people can't even by XRP right now due to popular exchanges not accepting new registrations. 
1,"Have you even bothered checking the market recently?

Give it a rest already and stop acting like the pull back is only localised to a certain coin.
"
1,Someone put blinders on and forgot to look at most of the market right now... Also got their math wrong.
1,Protip: Buy Tron if its less than $0.13 and then just wait for it to go over $0.20 again. 
1,"I  think you all are missing the bigger picture here.

Look at the amazing public reaction to this news. The mere mention of an old school firm using blockchain tech doubled the size of the company. Wow 2018 is going to be great. This should also encourage companies to really push the envelope of the eth platform too which is great. It;s been said before but the best use case of eth have probably not even been thought of yet..."
1,"Kodak is a relic of a bygone era and they're getting into crypto to persuade the market that they've got tech ""cred"" and are down with the cool kids.

Where's that Steve Buscemi meme ...
"
1,Is that what is causing the crash? 
1,"Much like when China clamped down, multiple times. There is a big world out there and even though people panic at first, it works itself out in the long run. "
1,"In my view all this just proves even more why this technology is valuable. These people that are supposed to be our servants become our masters when they see their power threatened.

This is all as expected and exactly the reason why this tech is so valuable.

Moreover, as a centralized and bureaucratic organization (government) does not stand a chance against a distributed and regenerative system, all these efforts will miserably fail.
"
1,Complete and utter waste of time. Coinbase couldn't give a tin shit. 
1,"Dogecoin could get 5,000 signatures. Such wow. Very much. "

"
1,Remember when the sky was falling this weekend? People need to calm down. Bitcoin Platinum Plus or whatever isn’t going to be the long term solution. 
1,Thanks Microsoft for doing bitcoin a solid
1,"In 21st, they seem not caring about misspelling, too!"
1,"my question is, why would anybody use xlm for goods and services if there is an expectation by the investment base that it's price is going to go up?"
1,I'm increasingly super-excited about the galactic possibilities of XLM.
1,"Is the idea that they will make it possible to trade from all kinds of coins with xrb? What about fiat trade, wouldnt that be a valueble step in the development of xrb also? for a long time most people will use fiat, but you could imagine that you could send ""money"" from one country to another imedeately by using xrb as the carrier, but being able to change it on the fly for US dollar, YEN, BTC or whatever in both ends. "
1,"is this decentralized exchange?

only XRB/LTC tho?

1,"Problem with WaveCrest card issuer - so Coinsbank, TenX, Bitwala, Xapo, Wirex (etc) affected and shut their cards. "
1,I'm not too surprised. These cards are relying on Visa's existing infrastructure to make their competing product work. Why would visa play ball? A point-of-service payment product like a card is going to have to figure out how to be independent.
1,Oh cool. Will they fork if Vitalik doesn’t like the outcome?
1,"Lord knows the laws and regulations of every nation need to be put into some form that isn't archaic crap. At this point in time, for instance, in America literally nobody can tell you how many federal laws and regulations there are. And no efforts are made to clean out old garbage, which is why millions of people are technically felons and don't even know it.

It will be very exciting to see blockchain impact so many areas, but especially this.
"
1,This is quite a surprise and good news. I’m a native and I wasn’t expecting that.
1,"I was recently at an IBM conference talking about their blockchain tech in application to the Oil & Gas supply chain. Supper interesting, raising a lot of questions. But also a lot of identification and theory has been completed in supply chain management of fossil fuels by involved groups."
1,It's great that users can trade with ETH currency also. 
1,"Just stop using them, Petitions are useless Money is Stronger."
1,Every time I see a thread like this I am perturbed how much people pleading to Coinbase resemble little kids asking their parents with tears in their eyes to buy them a new toy.
1,"Really good project. Also, what do you guys think about another promising icos? RightMesh, experty, NAU?"
1,"So, this is amazing. The fact that Ethereum could solve election fraud is incredible. That being said - is there any monetary gain in this? Will ETH be needed for these transactions?"
1,That's amazing news! Thanks for the hard work!
1,I was wondering when something like this would happen. Great work! I'm excited to see what becomes of this.
1,Alex - are you still in Rio? I'm there too. Would be cool to meet up if you have time :)

The video represents the original concept behind Vechain: product tracking services. Although this is still important, perhaps essential, it misrepresents the spoke of what they've been trying to accomplish these last two years.

1,Hell yeah! It’s gonna be the blockchain century!
1,"Well, he's not wrong. Something which has no utility is useless, and in order for cryptocurrencies and blockchain to truly revolutionize, it has to do something nothing else can do. I'm more stoked about stuff like Bitcoin Cash getting more and more vendor adoption than I am about Ripple shooting up towards a $100 billion market cap. Ripple is just another banker tool, it makes it quicker to move cash around. Big whoop, from the point of view of seeing society revolutionized. Ethereum is still one of the most exciting approaches and it's the furthest along towards really producing exciting things. Time will tell."
