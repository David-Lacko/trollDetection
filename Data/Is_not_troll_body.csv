0,disclaimer  i think obama should nominate someone  and the senate should hold confirmation hearings but this article does not accurately describe most republicans  statements on this issue  the vast majority of republican statements  although  notably  not the cruz one cited in the article  carefully phrase the issue as whether a nominee has been  nominated and confirmed  in the president s last year in office  although kennedy was confirmed in 1988  he was nominated by reagan at the end of 1987  so he does nt fall under this definition 
0,either way the process will be dragged out until after the elections the gop have the votes in the senate to say no and would rather gamble in 2016 they at least had the decency to inform everyone of what exactly they re doing this time around

0,somehow i thought this would be about them working in place of strikers  the usual meaning of  cross the picket line  which i did think was an odd choice for s first date for anyone curious here is the full quote  from hillary  around which the article is based ethical or not  your choice  i m just providing the quote for those who do nt feel like clicking  gt  we both had wanted to see a mark rothko exhibit at the yale art gallery but  because of a labor dispute  some of the university s buildings  including the museum  were closed as bill and i walked by  he decided he could get us in if we offered to pick up the litter that had accumulated in the gallery s courtyard watching him talk our way in was the first time i saw his persuasiveness in action we had the entire museum to ourselves we wandered through the galleries talking about rothko and twentiethcentury art i admit to being surprised at his interest in and knowledge of subjects that seemed  at first  unusual for a viking from arkansas we ended up in the museum s courtyard  where i sat in the large lap of henry moore s sculpture drape seated woman while we talked until dark 
0,small government 
0,let s clarify this headline  during bush  13  more people joined the government payroll under obama  it continued to grow  but only by 8   the obama years have more federal employees than the bush years the government did not get leaner  it simply got bigger slower

0,kennedy having been nominated in 1987 to fill a vacancy created in 1987 a vacancy extended due to the rejection of robert bork for purely ideological reasons  got ta suspect a lot of rs remember that their sc nominees since bork almost always get hassled and delayed but the dem nominees got free rides this time around  why should they let a judge on the court that ll put a liberal majority on the court  it s not dems are gon na just let a president cruz appoint a conservative to replace ginsburg  this has all been building up for years since the dems stopped robert bork

0,this is great  what a bunch of high energy individuals who want to see their country become great again  there s an authenticity in these men and their support for trump that i do nt think any of the other candidates  besides bernie  are even close to and it speaks to trump s character  to let them come and take the mic  and show us the viewer  that trump is real  he inspires  and he s a genuine guy that truly believes in the messages he preaches  and wants to improve the lives of the average american citizen

0,welcome to the information age  where your past words and exploits are but a click away and your facts and arguments that played so well to a captive audience  are disseminated and refuted within 24 hours and before they ve had their chance to sway voters 
0,perhaps this is a reminder of what may happen when we expand government to do  everything   little considering that taxpayers do nt have enough money for  everything  i wonder what the city  county  and national governments associated with flint have spent on projects over the last 20 years that were less important than replacing lead pipes that bring water into people s homes  or understanding that the chemistry of drinking water is indeed important when lead pipes are still extant you can try to make this a democrat  republican  liberal  conservative issue  but it s really a demonstration of how government systems can go wrong when the servants of the people lose interest in their service  and the people lose sight of demanding government do basic things before it starts doing political things 
0,even more infuriating is that the government lets wealthy and well connected criminals get away with things like poisoning the water supply 
0,send the military and the plumbers in rip that water system apart and replace it i know that will still take a while  but the city is in ruined condition major overhaul required
0,2016 0 1 6 but this a failure on the government of flint  not the free market  from what i ve seen the free market has actually been doing a lot to offset some of horrible conditions there i do nt know how many articles i ve seen of celebrities donating free water to flint for publicity  including bernie himself 
0,reno nevada is a lot like vegas but  but with more meth use and higher minimum wages seriously  the city is so diverse we put the biggest in our people and little in our wieners if you think reno just a joke than you should probably take down to mexico i bet you did nt know that reno is reindeer in spanish and if you try to leave us you just might vanish reno is like a monkey going branch to branch one second you re here and then at mustang ranch at that ranch there s really no horses just a lot of men with a lot of divorces  i do nt think anyone who is from nevada will read this article and take much away from it

0,27 upvotes and no comments  must be a shitty article inflating bernie somehow   reads headline  ooooh  it s a shitty article shilling the fact that a latino supports bernie  take that hillary  where is your minority support now  edit  s
0,gt  hillary clinton  who fought to the left of barack obama in 2008 on topics such as health insurance  appears today as if she is defending the status quo  i felt obama was going to be more liberal than hillary  was i wrong to think that in 2008 
0,i will be really satisfied if the final presidential nominees are bernie sanders and donald trump because it means the system is nt completely broken and we re only offered the choices of gop or goplite

0,that  casino voter guide   http  bigassetshuffingtonpostcomnvcasinovoterguidepdf  is pure garbage here are some highlights   hillary is designated  opensupportive  of gaming  apparently for paying some recent  lukewarm lip service to casino moguls this is despite her opposition to casinos when she was first lady of arkansas  which is mentioned first in the guide    ben carson is designated  opensupportive   and ted cruz is designated  mixed   but they have the same views  that it s up to individual states whether to allow gambling   cruz apparently loses points for saying the government should nt subsidize casino owners   bernie sanders is designated  mixed   citing  no information available  i suppose they could nt be bothered to make a fiveminute phone call to his campaign before printing up these brochures   donald trump is designated as  mixed   apparently because his atlantic city casinos went bust  along with the rest of ac s local economy   it s mentioned that trump currently operates a hotel on the vegas strip  but no bonus points appear to have been awarded for this

0,one problem that will need to be addressed before even mr sanders  economic prescriptions can work  our currency is overloaded  in a computer program  if the programmer tries to do too many things with one variable  the result is sure failure humans overload their currencies in the same way and to the same result  they try to make their currencies do too many things at the same time a medium of exchange  a medium of wealth storage  a means of demonstrating success  etc this can be fixed by using specific currencies for specific things  a saving currency  a trading currency  an investment currency  etc make tax policies specific to the uses of the various currencies and to their conversions from one type to another this would require secure electronic currencies  on a related note  what is a good way to really screw up a government  hoard their currency or otherwise take it out of circulation  the us and other governments are experiencing this now as multinational corporations stash currencies in outofreach banks governments are foolish to allow these people  aka  corporations   to undermine their currencies in this manner

0,gt  the group s voter guide would probably pass muster in the precitizens united days  says larry noble  a lawyer for campaign legal center and former general counsel for the federal election commission  so the article is saying that  citizens united  has very little to do with this ability to essentially endorse candidates  before  citizens united   there was nothing wrong with a corporation saying  hillary clinton hates puppies   because the law drew a line at  hillary clinton hates puppies and you should nt vote for her  i m not really sure that makes a huge difference

0,in a way  this is how government is supposed to work  she s going to change her stance to represent the will of the people in order to win the election  because the election system essentially demands that  what i m concerned with is which ideals politicians will pander to  when politicians say that they think pp will make partial birth abortions mandated for all people  i want to hate that politician and their voters  when politicians say that they think gay marriage should be legal  but they did nt think that before  of course i m going to be suspect of their opinion but i am glad that they changed their mind to that stance  and i m glad the voters put that pressure on

0,of course is this really not common knowledge  do people really not realize it s an attempt to let a republican president nominate someone 
0,gt  then again  recognize that the two picks that the president has selected are ideologues  so there  s really no reason to believe that his next pick wouldn  t be an ideologue also  a  we d have to go back to anthony kennedy probably to find a supreme court nominee who was nt an ideologue  and even then  most were surprised kennedy s voting record turned out to be moderate  b  the president has nt picked yet therefore no one knows if this pick  who does not yet exist  is an ideologue  or not no one knows who it is  no one has had a chance to examine the person s record no one has had a chance to interview the person and to find out their thoughts and positions  basically  obama could pick someone so conservative that they make scalia seem like a bleedingheart liberal  and the republicans would still be opposed no on substance  but because its obama s pick they are opposed to everything obama does because obama did it they disagree with much of what obama does for substantive reasons  of course  but with all of it for the childish reason of trying to prevent obama from doing anything at all  even when they agree with him 
0,how close can the bush brothers be  they do nt even have the same accent 
0,bernie sanders and the whitehouse  if you think the two do nt go together  you re not alone but you re also wrong  not that he would hold that against you because sanders  with apologies to the democrats  barack obama  is perhaps the nicest and most sincere man in politics and has been for 40 years  walk through congress with sanders before the gates open and you ll see him greet the security guards and ushers by name sit near the podium during fillibusters and you ll hear him call out to the lobbyists watch him afterward and you ll find him standing patiently by his locker  respectfully answering the lamest questions from reporters representing the smallest hometown newspapers  that was nt something you would see with hillary clinton  clinton would question your parentage  sanders will ask about your kids  then listen intently to the answer  when the supreme court held a memorial service for justice scalia  sanders flew to texas to see his family  then flew right back to take part in the service never mind that it was his only day off in a month  it s just respect   sanders said  yet a politician who shows respect to everyone does nt always see it in return  clearly sanders lacks the glitz and glamour  the flamboyance and the egotism to stand out in a tabloid world which is why he s thought of primarily as a nice guy and not a great politician  truth is  he s both  he s also crew cuts and blue collars he s middle america  right down to the  please  and  thank you  in his world  guns are for hunting  not for carrying into night clubs  no wonder the license plate on his pickup truck  what else would he drive   once read dbth  shorthand for do nt believe the hype  but you can believe the numbers  which make a strong case that sanders should be the president  in this case  a nice guy should finish first

0,the aca is better than what we had before  but it s still far from a good system millions of people still have no access to health care because they ca nt afford the insurance premiums even people with decent insurance are going bankrupt because of deductibles  copays and expensive premiums the insurance industry does nt give a shit about our health it s time to get rid of the health insurance industry it should not exist it is just a parasite 
0,you know what is the current situation with healthcare in america   44 million people in this country do not have health insurance   33 million more are under insured   29 million adults fall into the medicaid coverage gap in which 89  are from the south 45  are white 41  are full time workers 26  are from texas  source   http  kfforghealthreformissuebriefthecoveragegapuninsuredpooradultsinstatesthatdonotexpandmedicaidanupdate  this is obamacare this is the aca  i think  and i believe many would agree  that hillary s  i m going to build on the aca  is really  i m going to make sure the health insurance industry remains a critical part of our healthcare system  whether or not medicare for all  single payer is  the  solution to our healthcare crisis  it is something worth pursuing throw out those who wish to keep the status quo 
0,if medicaid expansion had been mandatory as in the original law  i think obamacare would be doing a much better job  however complying with the regulations made the private insurance market pretty brutal as far as sticker shock goes the new normal is a highdeductible plan  which incurs a lot more out of pocket lump payouts trying to meet that deductible if you  have health insurance  with a  3000 deductible  you can still easily go bankrupt when that bill hits  if not immediately then somewhere along the journey to your  10000 out of pocket maximum for the year  i have a middleclass job but the only way i could pay for the outofpocket expenses to treat my wife s cancer was borrowing from my 401k  most people are nt so lucky  situations like this are just so unfuckingnecessary that it s incredibly frustrating if america ca nt figure out affordable universal healthcare like every other wealthy country  then america is nt that freaking great

0,interesting piece of data from this poll  gt  while sanders has drawn a significant portion of his support from the youngest voting bloc  under the age of 30   just 25 percent of millennial black voters said they are supporting the vermont senator  compared with 64 percent who said they are backing clinton the reverse is true among white millennials  who support sanders 75 percent to 22 percent  this does nt really conform with the media narrative i wonder if there are other polls with similar results 
0,small government my ass   
0,gt  it s very important in the long run  to elect a woman for president    says 53yearold lisa mcallister  i think we ve seen that with president obama  that he s brought racial issues to the forefront that we need to have at the forefront it s more than women s turn to have a woman in the white house    obama has not brought racial issues to the forefront   whatever attention is being paid to racial issues in this country is entirely due to people recording instances of police brutality towards black people and circulating them online black lives matter would not exist if not for these recordings the fact that black lives matter exists at all during an obama presidency is a sign that he has nt done anything nearly enough to address racial issues in this country    electing a black president has not solved racism electing a woman president will not solve sexism  
0,i m willing to bet that most of hillary supporters  or any nonbernie supporters  who have nt seen a single video of bernie will at least entertain the idea of jumping ship once they do see one of his videos  i like this one in particular   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  ru3nkvvxcss

0,good for them  it s pretty amazing that people are upset that the clintons picked up litter that the people who were being paid to do so refused to do  it s like many people always say if they feel the compensation for the job is nt fair  quit and find a job that s more in line with what they feel they should be getting  if they ca nt find a job that pays what they think they are worth  perhaps they are overestimating the value of the skills they bring to the table  i m aware this article was submitted as an attack piece  but the story makes bill clinton look awesome

0,uhh i have a great idea  let s get ken starr back and give him unlimited power and tons of money to investigate endlessly and if he takes long enough maybe she will get caught having sex with an intern and all the little trolls can say  see i told you so  we always knew she did something  we just had to wait long enough for her to actually do it  gotcha  she s not my first choice for president but if she s so damn good at getting away with all the stuff she s been accused of for 30 years  then maybe she d make a tough and crafty president  in her absence i would nominate the following paragons of virtue  bob livingston  tom delay denny hastert scooter libby newt gingrich irancontra etcetc  yo investigate this  shit happens on both sides of the aisle but since the day bill clinton announced his first run for president  the republicans have redefined the term  witch hunt  if they were half as obsessive about fixing things  we d all be living in the  real  america we all deserve
0,there is certainly an age gap going on here it seems as if the only retort that hillary supporters can muster is  young people are too naive to know that they should support clinton  this seems similar to their other arguments  eg  women who support bernie are not real feminists  men who support bernie are sexist  berniebros    considering the incredible skill that young people have in accessing good and relativelyunbiased information quickly using modern technology  the position that young people are naive or underinformed seems to fall flat considering older generations  reliance on outdated information media technologies for their information  media that is largely controlled by corporate clinton supporters  it may be that it is the older generation of voters who are both naive and underinformed  i d like to hear other people s thoughts on this

0,keep just these recent decisions in mind where justice scalia was a part of the 54 majority that could have different outcomes if he is replaced by a democrat president   in a 54 majority limits in mccutcheon v fec  the court invalidated the aggregate contribution limits that were first put in place by the federal election campaign act of 1971   in atamp  t mobility v concepcion  the 54 majority ruled that corporations can effectively mandate arbitration agreements that preclude consumers from bringing class actions to combat fraud and enforce their rights without access to an impartial judge and jury  and without the resources to go it alone in arbitration  people typically abandon their claims and corporate wrongdoers are never held accountable many states enacted consumer protection laws to curtail the pernicious practice of forced arbitration  but in concepcion the supreme court held that such laws are preempted by an old federal statute from 1925 called the federal arbitration act  faa    the 54 majority in michigan v epa overturned epa regulations safeguarding communities from toxic pollution by power plants that causes up to 11000 premature deaths each year essentially  the court  s decision places a premium on businesses  bottom lines over public health and limits the epa  s ability to regulate hazardous air pollutants over the objections of corporate interests   in ledbetter v goodyear tire and rubber co  the 54 court majority made it virtually impossible to bring a claim of longrunning sex or race discrimination in pay under title vii of the 1964 civil rights act  a decision later reversed by a congressional statute a woman had been paid less than her male peers for 20 years and the court stated she had no right to bring a lawsuit for equal pay because she failed to file suit within 180 days of the first discrimination  even though she had no way of learning about the discrimination until years later   in davis v fec  a 54 majority overturned the  millionaire  s amendment   congress  s effort to level the playing field in the political process and reduce the influence of wealth on elections by increasing the contribution limits to candidates facing selffunded opponents   in florence v board of chosen freeholders  the 54 court majority ruled that local officials can stripsearch anyone accused of any crime  even if there is no reason to suspect contraband or concealed weapons  and can not be sued for invasion of privacy   the 54 majority in shelby county v holder overturned a key section of the 1965 voting rights act  making it much harder to protect against discrimination in voting not only did the majority dismissively reject tens of thousands of pages of congressional findings supporting the coverage formula contained in section 4 of the nearlyunanimous 2006 reauthorization of the vra  but the opinion was noted for failing to provide any legal or constitutional rationale for its holding nothing in the text of the constitution was cited to justify the court  s novel decision to strike down the cornerstone of american civil rights law   the 54 majority in leegin creative leather products inc v psks inc overruled a 96yearold rule that had made vertical price fixing per se illegal under federal antitrust law overturning the almost century of antitrust law  the court decided that manufacturers and retailers could sometimes engage in pricefixing in dissent  justice breyer cited studies estimating that this change in law would cost consumers  300 billion a year in increased prices on everyday items   a 53 majority  since justice sotomayor recused herself  in american express co v italian colors restaurant ruled that a smallbusiness owner could not bring an antitrust lawsuit challenging a large corporation  s alleged abuse of its monopoly power  even though  it was claimed  it was that very monopoly power that allowed the corporation to force an agreement to arbitrate and not litigate all complaints against it the court upheld the use of forced arbitration clauses even if it made enforcing federal laws like the sherman act practically impossible in dissent  justice kagan explained that the court  s decision allows   t  he monopolist    to use its monopoly power to insist on a contract effectively depriving its victims of all legal recourse   the 54 majority in burwell v hobby lobby stores  inc decided that forprofit corporations can claim religious rights and can exempt themselves from federal laws requiring them to provide contraceptive coverage to employees the majority also rewrote the religious freedom restoration act  with potentially dangerous consequences for lgbt and other americans   in parents involved in community schools v seattle school district  the 54 court majority prohibited school districts from attempting voluntarily to promote school desegregation through student reassignment plans   in walmart v dukes  approximately one million female walmart employees tried to file a classaction lawsuit over claims of sex bias the 54 decision by the court made it nearly impossible for a class of workers to use for widespread corporate misbehavior that comes in the form of unwritten policies essentially  every worker has to bring their own individual claim  making walmart and other large companies realistically judgment proof to these types of claim   in two 54 decisions  solid waste agency of northern cook county v us army corps of engineers and rapanos v united states  the court effectively took many waterways outside the protection of the clean water act  even though pollution from these waterways can dirty the drinking water of 117 million americans as a result of the court  s decision  1500 major pollution investigations have been halted  and epa actions against water polluters have fallen by 50    in national federation of independent business v sebelius which upheld the patient protection and affordable care act under the taxing power of congress  a 54 majority on the court overturned 70 years of precedent dealing with the commerce clause prior to this case  the court had held that congress has the authority to regulate activities that have a substantial effect on interstate commerce in the area of economic activities   substantial effect  can be found based on the cumulative impact of the activity across the country for example  the supreme court held that congress could use its commerce clause authority to prohibit individuals from cultivating and possessing small amounts of marijuana for personal medicinal use because marijuana is bought and sold in interstate commerce the relationship between health care coverage and the national economy is even stronger and more readily apparent the court had also said that congress could use its commerce power to forbid hotels and restaurants from discriminating based on race  even though their conduct was refusing to engage in commercial activity under an unbroken line of precedents stretching back 70 years  congress has the power to regulate activities that  taken cumulatively  have a substantial effect on interstate commerce people not purchasing health insurance unquestionably has this effect this ruling  if a liberal justice is replaced with someone like scalia  could overturn vast amounts of social programs like medicare and worker protections  on the other hand  occasionally a justice like justice kennedy has sided with the liberal justices to produce 54 decisions that would be in danger if a republican wins the white house and a liberal justice dies or retires while they are in office   in obergefell v hodges  a 54 court majority ruled that the constitution protects the right of samesex couples to marry   a 54 majority in texas department of housing and community affairs v the inclusive communities project upheld the longstanding interpretation of the federal fair housing act to prohibit practices with unjustified discriminatory impact   in massachusetts v epa  a 54 court majority upheld the authority of the epa to regulate greenhouse gases   a 54 majority upheld voterpassed nonpartisan redistricting reform in arizona state legislature v arizona independent redistricting commission   in williamsyulee v the florida bar  a 54 majority upheld a ban on state judicial candidates directly soliciting campaign funds   in boumediene v bush  a 54 majority ruled that prisoners detained in guantanamo can file habeas corpus petitions to challenge their detention   a 54 majority in alabama democratic conference v alabama invalidated a state redistricting scheme that used race to harm minority voters   a 54 majority ruled in favor of workers  rights in csx transportation v mcbride ruling railroads are liable for workers  injuries under federal statute if the railroad was partially responsible for the injury through its negligence

0,i do nt know why clinton and her campaign believes that the south is going to be a safe haven for her  you see  the thing about southern democrats is that they share alot of thoughts and feelings with southern republicans that live all around them  every day  for their entire lives  if you keep on hearing and seeing people talk about how much they hate hillary clinton as southern democrats do when they re around southern republicans  some of that will eventually seep in

0,the  mixed race  comment is odd but not completely out of line  notwithstanding the criticism of the random  democratic blogger  they quoted more damaging is probably his claim that hillary clinton is a  changemaker  who can get things done where president obama could not  for two primary reasons  1 anything that she can accomplish with an overwhelmingly republican congress will come at the expense of the voters she is courting in the democratic primary  2 it illustrates an undeserved smugness as well as disdain for president obama s accomplishments it also demonstrates that her attack on senator sanders for being insufficiently supportive of the president is disingenuous political theater

0,in fairness  before the tea party was coopted by fox news and freedomworks  it actually did have a legitimate grassroots origin which was born of   some   of the similar frustrations that sander s supporters are expressing now in this way the origins are not entirely dissimilar  what   i   think is amusing is that bill clinton is trying to smear sanders by comparing his supporters to a  successful  movement much as people may hate to admit it  the tea party completely changed the political landscape  and not just in dc  so i think the message is clear  folks former president bill clinton is telling sanders supporters that they too can change the entire political landscape   billisaberniebro
0,i do nt think that denigrating sanders supporters will prove to be a winning move for the clintons if hillary s supporters had half the passion as they do her campaign probably would nt be so nervous  in reality  i see huge differences between the sanders movement and the tea party the tea party was manufactured by fox news and freedomworks to serve the establishment s purpose whereas the sanders movement is a true grassroots movement against politics as usual night and day difference 
0,they say things like this because they are desperate to hold power attack  attack  attack desperate that is the clinton way it s disturbing that anyone would support this family people that desperate for power should never be allowed to have it i ve asked people to explain why they support hillary the answer  because republicans that s it bernie is simply a superior candidate in the face of that truth  you attack and hope something sticks may the entire clinton family fade to a footnote

0,i live in ypsilanti and go to school at emu the people saying this attendance was purely because of how close we are to ann arbor are ridiculous the turn out was crazy i had to work  but my brother went and said it was pretty special 
0,facebook  useful to reach our parents makes sense 
0,facebook videos  the deciding factor in choosing a president this is the future we choose 
0,the same thing happen to mewhen i saw a donal trump video  now i m for him 
0,thanks for sharing this people are unaware of what kind of movement is happening in the sanders campaign they just keep hearing  he ca nt win  but the reality is out there videos like this packing stadiums millions of individual donations the fight is nt over but clinton is scared and she s pulling out all the old tricks that keep things as the status quo talk to people  let them know 
0,wow  the older voters in this audio are condescending as all hell to millenials 
0,what a great endorsement for trump bush and now obama attacking him just cements him as antiestablishment 
0,i might be going out on a limb here but maybe  just maaaaybe i am guessing that not many trump supporters are fond of obama so this will only be fuel for the donald to use in his next rally speech 
0,let s be honest  it s george w could do it  anyone can do it 
0,why do pundits still say trump is nt  serious   trump clearly stands to benefit by winning  both in terms of his net assets and in terms of political power and prestige 
0,we may end up with an orangutan in the white houseseriously spend your perfectly good vote on bernie 
0,it s pretty likely the gop will have trump as their candidate  and wwwfivethirtyeightcom have been saying so for a while  however  the dems should be peachy so long as they do nt have a farleft extremist as their candidate oh  wait 
0,does no one here remember anything that happened back when the clintons were still in arkansas  anyone that wants this person to be the leader of the   free world   has either had their head in the sand for the past 40 years  does nt pay attention to the history of this family  does nt care  or is probably under the age of 25 
0,should nt that be the whole point of insurance  home insurance does nt pay your cable bill car insurance does nt fill up your gas tank 
0,i like bernie  but this is rsandersforpresident or rcirclejerk material
0,i would like to see some more realistic  pragmatic ideas rather than vague populist rhetoric every reddit article is the same kind of thing   bernie is right on poverty  i think it s bad to be poor  and people should be able to have money to buy things   i mean  i see a lot of complaints and virtually no plausible solutions being offered from bernie i m very skeptical of this kind of politician i appreciate his detachment from corporate benefactors in his campaign  though and  i think he does care  where i think hillary is probably a more shrewd politician rather than some compassionate visionary 
0,it s especially humorous because it s only  older democratic women  are  supposed  to go blindly hillary s way  because it s time for a woman candidate to be elected  men seem to be strangely irrelevant no  it s just that voters can actually do whatever they feel like  amazingly and bernie sanders tells the truth and we like it and hillary s simply a skilled politician  although i realize most of you poor sap s ignore it anyway but enough of them  believe me  are listening intently  and are voting with their feet for bernie 
0, remind you of anyone    http  imgurcomgallery7drhiqr 
0,i know reddit just  loves  hitler comparisons by inference  but hitler  strom thurmond  even donald trump are passionate speakers that alone is not enough  i m not lumping sen sanders in that group  but i get actively pissed reading insipid supporter perspectives like this  no matter who the candidate of topic is  be it a feel the berner or a tea bagger  we get the democracy we deserve  if we do nt dug deeper than a passionate message  i fear even a donald trump could be considered a politically viable candidate 
0,only 40  of likely democratic voters have decided who they are voting for though and only 34  of likely black voters have decided i think that bodes well for bernie who has a much better ground game  source  http  wwwcnncom20160216politicssouthcarolinapollcnnorcindexhtml the part i referred to is near the bottom
0,hillary s campaign is essentially 3 vs 1  bill and chelsea are continuously sent out to do hillary s dirty work  sanders campaign can rebuff bill  but rebuffing chelsea would undoubtedly result in the clintons labelling him a sexist creeper  luckily they ve been smart enough to avoid that trap 
0,looks like clinton is doing well in states that wo nt vote democrat in the general election 
0,the number of hillary canvassers positively dwarfs the number of sanders canvassers bernie s online support does nt stretch out to the real world
0,tldr   i too  am stupid 
0,and this is where clinton is supposed to be strongest  she s plummeted the last 2 months in sc
0,why do we care so much about sc  when was the last time a democrat won sc in the general election 
0,after living in south carolina for a year and keeping in touch with people there  i would nt be ecstatic about this if i were a clinton supporter maybe  i d stick with  clinton is favored by 18 points in  a state    i ve got no hate for sc but  let s be honest  even the progressives there average about 30 years behind the curve of liberal culture 
0,in a town that borders one of the most liberal cities in the country often called 6 square miles surrounded by reality 
0,just so everyone knows it was pretty damn cold that day in the morning around 20 degrees f  
0,nor might be turning finally instead of bashing sanders
0,anyone who votes for hillary clinton because she s a woman is what s wrong with this country if you took even 1 hour to do some research on who your electing for to be the freaking commander and chief of our country you would realize that bernie is way more trustworthy of your vote then hillary the lord of lies 
0, bernie supporters think a woman whose mind can be changed by a facebook video is a role model  you ca nt make this shit up 
0,gt  sanders  support is more pronounced among young women especially one survey showed women voters under 35 preferred sanders by an almost 20point margin  while young men preferred him only by 4 points  so in fact  ms  steinem  not where all the boys are 
0,call the grounds crew  cause team hilary s moving the goalposts
0,victory   
0,i for one welcome the rise of the green tea party 
0,gt  yeah  i am telling people what they want to hear  people want jobs they want health care they want educational opportunities for their kids they want to deal with climate change they want the wealthiest people to pay their fair share of taxes yeah  that  s what i  m telling people and on every one of those issues  that is exactly what the american people want 
0,i just love the fact that bernie is genuinely as frustrated as most people in america 
0,smart move by the bernster just respond as if bill clinton is a harmless rambling little man which is what he s becoming  at this point 
0,sometimes  a lot of times actually  i really genuinely think that bernie sanders is a truly honest man  a gifted man  one in a generation that s not to be taken lightly  i really do believe that in my heart of hearts listen to him absolutely shred bill clinton in no uncertain terms i like this man 
0,bill flubbed agin 
0,billy is so silly 
0,the difference between the tea party and feel the bern is that one of these groups can hold down a job 
0,currently in nc the only health insurance provider  blue cross and blue shield  for about 1015 eastern counties is going to cease to do business there  so people with preexisting conditions who were finally able to get insurance due to the aca are now being told they will have no coverage within their own county so their only recourse is to travel hours away from their own towns and buy insurance  then whenever they get sick to drive those same hours to see a doctor at all the aca was great for a lot of reasons but it is still very lacking and we need to move forward on true universal health care  not universal health insurance 
0,just heard this on my daily listen of npr
0,i had high hopes for the aca  but it has not done anything for me all the plans are either too expensive for me or have very high deductibles i m all for single payer everyone puts in and everyone gets covered seems simple to me 
0,or worse  only a percentage of a catastrophic cost  mine only pays 80   20  of omgfuckingbullshitwtfnofuckingwayfuckthis is still bullshit 
0,if he s as nuts as the tea party  why is hillary trying to pretend she shares the same platform 
0,shots fired 
0,so she wants a token female in the oval office  yeah because that will solve all gender equality issues 
0,obama can be pretty savage 
0,voting for someone because of a facebook video nice 
0,i see what you did there barack  well played  well played 
0,it would weaken institutional racism and sexism dramatically
0,hillary delivers her hot button issues often repeated but with no details of how she could end racism or sexism she likes to talk about both 
0,so apparently hillary clinton is going to end racism and sexism  that s what she s implying i think we can all see what s she s doing and how she s taking advantage of people it s really exploitative and toxic clinton does nt know how to not be a racist 
0,what the fuck is wrong with her  she is the most detached and oblivious person 
0,if we discovered a way to make solar power 100  efficient  would that end racism  oh  i guess we should nt try then 
0,no  it isnt designed to  but a more equal economy would help alleviate the worst effects of racism and sexism on minorities
0,it would end her donors  support 
0,would nt it be cool if breaking up the big banks actually did end racism and sexism that d be awesome 
0,not the best analogy being in the cabinet does nt mean you just get to do whatever you want you d probably have to stay in your lane  how about   bernie sanders spent his 30year political career not just talking about income inequality and the necessity of government regulation on big banks  but acting on it does anyone believe goldman sachs would pay him  250000 to recount his experiences  
0,not too terrible considering clinton was expecting to crush sanders into the dirt in sc just a few weeks ago  sc might actually be a nail biter if he keeps gaining 
0,animal cruelty would also persist after these financial institutions are broken up why does bernie hate kittens 
0,no but it would stop too big to fail  banking 
0,non sequitur misdirection logic  no 
0,the video i could find  https  grabiencomstoryphp  id  48613 quote in full  gt  not everything is about an economic theory right  if we broke up the big banks tomorrow  and i will if they deserve it  if they pose a systemic risk  i will  would that end racism  would that end sexism  would that end discrimination against the lgbt community  would that make people feel more welcoming to immigrants overnight    gt  i  m the only candidate who will take on every barrier to progress i  m the only candidate who has a record of taking on those barriers i  m the only candidate who will stand with you in every single fight  no matter how hard it is or how long it takes 
0,if we made hillary president tomorrow  would that end racism  would that end sexism 
0,what the fuck kind of broken logic is that 
0,curing polio did nt end racismsexism it was still a good idea 
0,  fallacy of relative privation    dismissing an argument or complaint due to the existence of more important problems in the world  regardless of whether those problems bear relevance to the initial argument 
0,electing obama did nt end racism  electing hillary wo nt end sexism  and electing bernie wo nt end antisemitism  so how about we vote on platforms rather than which bathroom the candidate uses 
0,since when does the secretary of state has to deal with breaking banks or not 
0,hillary is a status quo presidential candidate  if she gets the nomination and the job things will remain mostly as they are with little attempt to change them  the big banks know this 
0,no probably not however  it would weaken the current status quo which has continued to perpetuate racism and sexism 
0,clinton is an unethical fraudster fact 
0,40  of those polled are still undecided  sc will be a lot closer than nh was 
0,better than a 40 or 50 point lead like a month ago she s dropping fast  poll has an a on 538
0,gt  suppose bernie sanders had spent four years in obama s cabinet and tried to break up the big banks does anyone believe goldman sachs would pay him  250000 to recount his experiences  except hillary did nt say that by all accounts given so far  it was more a rahrah speech than it was her telling goldman of her accounts of trying to break up the big banks so this entire statement is based on a false supposition 
0,gt  the wages of other workers would fall since displaced manufacturing workers would be forced to look for jobs in retail and other sectors the increased supply of workers lowers wages in these other sectors as well recent research by some of the country s top labor economists confirms that trade has been a major factor depressing the wages of large numbers of workers  step 1  have your husband  as president  champion legislation that ships manufacturing to china step 2  walmart becomes the country s largest employer of new lowwage workers step 3  get on the board of directors at walmart step 4  profit  step 5  run for president
0,the secretary of state is being taken to task for notbreaking up domestic banks  this is officially the dumbest anticlinton thing on rpolitics this week 
0,no  a bank would nt want someone who s actively trying to stop them from profiting so handsomely speaking at their institution  because you know exactly what a bernie speech to goldman sachs would sound like 
0,i find it funny how almost every comment here is making fun of the stupidity of this post and article yet the article has 4000 points  87  liked  and is sitting at the top of reddit 
0,secretaries of state break up big banks 
0,yes  well maybe not 250k since he wasnt first lady as well  but there would probably be a big interest in getting him as speaker too
0,jeb needs to get his mommy to help him campaign  and when that does nt work he calls in his brother who is nationally regarded as responsible for many of the problems we face as a country today  please clap 
0,absofuckinglutely the correct question is do you think he d take it
0,i dont care what the polls say jeb has no chance of winning 
0,did you guys watch the speeches  i think it helped him people who do nt want anything to do with the bush family can snicker all they want  but it was definitely a plus for jeb bush has a 70  approval rating with republican voters it ll help with the nomination at least  w warmed up the crowd and jeb had a tough act to follow and it lit a flame jeb has never spoken with so much furor before it s a newer jeb  but probably too late to change much but  if jeb continues with the same confidence as yesterday he could climb to 2nd place rationally  in the very least it bought in the spotlight and people actually can hear about jeb s stance on things 
0,that s why it s just gon na be south carolina where he s extremely popular  alot of veterans and alot of neoconservative   after that  its gon na be back to just jeb 
0,desperation does funny things to a guy 
0,w and cheney and rumsfeld should all be indicted as war criminals the decision to invade iraq was the greatest blunder in american history and we will paying the dividends for at least another generation 
0,he is correct  in that the fact the tea party was a republican cashroots campaign that took over and radicalized republicans and got them participating in government if this is somehow a bad thing for democrats to emulate then i missed the memo stating the government is a representation of corporate interests and not a representation of the peoples interests  edited for clarity 
0,if government social programs lift people out of poverty  then why has poverty remained the same over the past 40 years 
0,if he had clinton s resume and was nt trying to dismantle the banking system  absolutely it s not like she was the only person they paid to speak they had an entire speaker series featuring successful people from diverse backgrounds 
0,gt  if this sounds strange  let s imagine a slightly different scenario suppose bernie sanders had spent four years in president obama s cabinet during which time he did everything he could to try to break up the big banks and have corporate criminals put behind bars does anyone believe goldman sachs would pay him  250000 to recount his experiences  yes 
0,ridiculous and obtuse argument but does nt matter because fuck hillary      _    _  
0,bernie sanders on goldman sachs in ypsilanti  michigan yesterday listen for yourself and decide for yourself  https  youtubeohzxb41nrmi
0,yes  obstruct the nominee let the nominee be another symbol of what republicans have brought to the table over the last 7 years the republican party is a national disgrace 
0,evidently tillis does nt really understand that it still obstructionism saying you re going to use every device available to block a nomination unless obama picks someone in the mold of scalia or it s just typical gop doublespeak saying his party wo nt be obstructiveas long as they get what they want  assholes man 
0,this article is just the consistent  hillary takes money from big banks  argument  only reworded poorly and framed in a way that makes no sense
0,every economist believes this is not going to do anything another big bank will just come up a few years after i think effective legislationlaws is a better action 
0,they voted for revolutionary change  they got a vetocracy 
0,if i were a wall street wolf  i would pay 250k for them to tell me how they tried to stop me  so i could learn more about how to defend my stake  and also because 250k is chump change 
0,so this is how it s going to be  endless posts about this  despite nothing actually happening yet 
0,funny  the only time i have personally heard the claim that planned parenthood was a conspiracysecret genocide of black people was from a professor that focused on black studies and who was herself black i also got to know a student who looked up to said professor as a mentor they both shared some of the most backwards  fuckedup  blmesque stances i have ever seen  this is not a conservative or liberal issue it s a misinformation issue people either make shit up to get what they want or they never bother finding out what s true or false before spouting shit to get what they want all dishonest sides will pull the same trick they want to break you down into groups so you re easier to control you can put any spin on any issue if you do nt care about the truth  here we see someone making an issue black and white while pretending to want to stop the issue from being black and white it is insane we have reached the point we have in politics everyone is contradicting themselves constantly the truth is the last thing they consider  i think the congresswoman made good points  and a gray stance would not bait as many clicks  but she is feeding the fire in her own way it is hypocritical and exhausting to see every day 
0,so we ve moved on to supposition articles now 
0,since when have social programs  actually  lifted minorities out of poverty 
0,its also just unwise if they block his pick long enough  he ll just make a recess appointment while they re on one of their many vacations boom  senate oversight bypassed its ugly  but they re playing ugly 
0,sanders supporters  one problem is that some of us ca nt get on board with the evil wall street stuff it s very difficult legally to say exactly why and how you re going to prosecute bankers for what happened in 2008 it s very difficult to craft regulations to correct exactly the things we want without having either very bad unintended consequences  or loopholes that render them useless i see it as a problem we have as a country  and something we really need to think about and be smart about bernie actually kinda scares me with his us vs them stuff  if you have the time  take a look at  this video   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  qclmwlgcgg0  of a slightly boring economist who s studied the problem extensively to me this is kind of talk and approach we need if we really want to solve the problem sure  it s not a rousing as bernie s power to the people  stuff  but there you go let the republicans have their demagogues  someone needs to be the smart party 
0,the more i listen to trump  the more i think trump is right planned parenthood and the like do much more than abortion  they assist our poor and downtrodden in times of hardship whether that be std prevention or medical care the fact that the republican establishment opposes this is just an act of pure disgusting obstrunctionism 
0,to be fair al gore came to my town  that is in the netherlands  last year to speak they paid him   150k iirc  i did nt go  tickets were quite expensive but i was pretty shocked how much some people get paid for a less than two hour speech
0,exactly this  if i do not explicitly see it  it does nt exist  mantra is ridiculously short sighted i ve said the same thing before  probably on here   the politicians that do literally change their vote for cash  seem to be the ones that get caught the goal of the money is to bring these people into the same social strata as those with the money make them part of the club the more they hang out  the more washed over with those ideals they will be dishonesty is not a simple process 
0,from the  cdc   http  wwwcdcgovmmwrpreviewmmwrhtmlss6108a1htm   among the 29 areas that reported crossclassified raceethnicity data for 2009  table 12     nonhispanic white women and nonhispanic black women accounted for the largest percentages of abortions  377  and 354   respectively     whereas   hispanic women and nonhispanic women in the other races category accounted for smaller percentages  206  and 63   respectively       nonhispanic white women had the lowest abortion rates  85 abortions per 1000 women aged 15  44 years    and ratios  140 abortions per 1000 live births     whereas nonhispanic black women had the highest abortion rates  325 abortions per 1000 women aged 15  44 years    and ratios  477 abortions per 1000 live births   among the 24 areas     that reported by raceethnicity every year during 2007  2009  abortion rates decreased for all racialethnic groups the abortion rate decreased 7  for nonhispanic white women  from 91 abortions per 1000 women in 2007 to 85 in 2009  and 6  for hispanic women  from 205 abortions per 1000 women in 2007 to 193 in 2009  but only 1  for nonhispanic black women  from 346 abortions per 1000 women in 2007 to 342 in 2009   in contrast  abortion ratios decreased among nonhispanic white women but not among women in any other racialethnic group for nonhispanic white women  the abortion ratio decreased 3   from 143 abortions per 1000 live births in 2007 to 138 in 2009   whereas the abortion ratio increased 4  for nonhispanic black women  from 481 abortions per 1000 live births in 2007 to 501 in 2009  and 2  for hispanic women  from 192 abortions per 1000 live births in 2007 to 195 in 2009   data also are reported separately by race and by ethnicity for 2009  tables 13 and 15  and for 2000  2009  tables 14 and 16

0,here a question for you would rather have uday or quesy running iraq after daddy saddam gets old and has heart attack like scalia 
0,are you kidding  of course they would  why do you think it s the toughest most vicious prosecutorsregulators get hired by the banks  not only do poachers make the best gamekeepers  but it also takes them out of the equation if gs offered bernie a million to do some work for them it would make it much harder for him to come down on them later 
0,this is what makes me think her supporters are so gullible she s playing them like a trumpet and they still defend her like she s the moral  pragmatic choice good luck 
0,poor jeb   
0,you know i ve been missing it  jeb just has a fucking brilliant sense of humor and he _is_ trying to lose like 100  trying hard as he can to lose this whole time  and he s a comedic genius

0,know thine enemy so yes they would he would most likely refuse it regardless if he was retired or not 
0,well  to be fair  those fees are just a drop in the bucket when you consider the clintons  massive haul
0,i know its intended to be a jab  but the tea party has been very effective at getting their vocal minority into a number of local and state positions 
0,its his brother  its not surprising its like bill supporting hillary 
0,just to remind people what the george w bush presidency was really like  lie on top of lie  https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  yykc4gd2id4 also  the lehman brothers subprime mortgage scheme that drained  7t out of the us economy  sending the us into the great recession of 2008 was concocted early in the bush presidency  somebody will eventually write the true history and legacy of the bush family  from george hw bush to george w bush  and it will expose a family that very nearly destroyed the us 
0,bill  why are you making me dislike you   why  i always liked bill clinton  thought he was a pretty good president how are comments like this supposed to make me feel

0,it rings of desperation 
0,that is so good  it should be in rshowerthoughts people are starting to wake up   
0,i thing goldman sachs is double playing you all 250k is absolutely nothing to them but it is enough to appear to support hillary without really helping her this obviously actually hurts her and helps sanders  the one they really want in office because they can us him to suck the blood out of our economy and send us into depression  where sachs will profit massively 
0,self posts not allowed oh wait unless it s from a corporate entity it is

0,somebody is about to get primaried
0,a rare conservative who actually fears his voters will reign him in for not doing his job  must be a swing state con 
0,well then it would be wise for democrats to fall in line would nt it  the tea party cost several representatives their jobs and fractured the republican party beyond repair  of course the tea party is just a front for monied interests to cripple the federal government  but i think my point still kind of stands 
0,it s the  third way  centrist obstructionists that impede progress they are those chanting  no we ca nt 
0,bernie sanders is no tea party insurrection 
0,this is just crazy  bernie fans are ideological purists  fighting against a democrat in name only  dino   and trying to purge the establishment from dc  the tea party are ideological purists  fighting against a republican in name only  rino   and trying to purge the establishment from dc  big difference 
0,theres no way thats going to turn voters off of hillary 
0,ok  that s it  fuck this guy 
0,solid move  if your intention is to fuck up at everything 
0,he is nt wrong bernie supporters often accuse her of not being a  true progressive   similar to how tea partiers primaried conservatives who they thought were rinos despite agreeing with them on most issues 
0, my father kept our country safe   jeb   tough guy  bush  outstanding applause 
0,great  now we just need to get 4 more with a conscience and we can get a justice passed 
0,it will be very interesting how this whole thing shakes out i saw an article about rand paul saying that obama has a conflict of interest in appointing a sc nominee since many of the cases the scotus will be reviewing are dealing with which powers the president does and does not have obama will pick someone who has similar views to himself  but it will be interesting to see what their thoughts on presidential powers is 
0,it is funny watching a dying party desperately exercise what power they have even if it makes them look like fools and only hurts their cause  btw my comments are related to how childish and foolish the party has acted in the last 5 years or so not saying they are going anywhere long term but it is just crazyness 
0,dubya has nt aged well saw him on tv last night and he looks every one of his 69 years 
0,does anyone know if conservatives  particularly republicans in the south  have some kind of more subtle agenda  s  beneath the veneer of  prolife  and  limited government   attempts to impede women s access to care in 2016 is so absurd that i often wonder if the motivations are deeper than just ignorancesexismracism  religion  and political ideology the ultimate consequences of interfering with women s health rights are so obviously ass backwards and to the detriment of society it makes my head explode  it would nt surprise me if many of these bastard politicians view such actions as a long term investment in their criminal justice systems and keeping their prisons filled  among other sinister motives  do these states  by chance  happen to reap any federal benefits from rampant populations growth  i know many red states get heavy federal subsidies it feels like there s more to it than concern for the  sanctity of life   perhaps i underestimate racism in the south 
0,absolutely you are out of your minds if you think bankers are nt going to want to hear the outgoing treasury secretary speak 
0,yes  they just want to throw money around for the fun of it have you not watch the wolf of wall street 
0,they care about black fetuses  not black people 
0,umm  what does this have to do with how much hillary sucks and how awesome bernie is and how he s going to save america  stay on topic please 
0,since when conservatives care about the black community 
0,i do nt know about the word  target   but i  do  know that if literally anything else had such a disparate impact on the black community  the left would be endlessly crying  racism  but the left is especially good at turning a blind eye when it comes to abortion  cf most prominent democrats  abhorrent views on lateterm abortion

0,if both sides of the abortion debate spent the money they spend fighting each other on ectogenesis research this entire argument would be over by now and both sides would get what they want  we d live in a society where a woman can remove an unwanted fetus and one where those unwanted fetuses do nt have to be destroyed when removed literally having your cake and eating it too  if you ever have donated to either side of the abortion debate please consider doing some research on ectogenesis and helping fund laboratories working on the technology  if we work at it we could all see a world where sexual intercourse and breeding become entirely disconnected from one another 
0,nice try bill  maybe tomorrow s spitball claim will actually stick

0,gt  debunked this assertion with data showing that fewer than 1 in 10 abortion providers are in majorityblack neighborhoods the black population is largely concentrated into fairly tight areas  and make up less than 12  of the us population it would be interesting to see what percentage of black people as a whole have an abortion clinic in their zip code  zip was what was used in this  study   vs white people  to be a majority black neighborhood there would have to be quite a few black people there since their usage means that black people made up of 50  or more of the neighborhood  it could be 49  black  48  hispanic and they would nt consider it  majority black  
0,it is a simple fact that not only are abortion rates higher in countries where it is illegal  but also abortion related health complications and deaths for women increase dramatically in these places whatever your view on life  souls  zygotes being children or whatever it is a fact that making abortions safe and available reduce many immediate atrocious problems in society and the benefits clearly outweigh the cost

0,appontment  not nominee 
0,anybody who says  well i guess bills kind of right  the two movements are kind of similar in some respects  is missing the point  while bill is correct hes only trying to make a loaded point in an attempt to discredit the sanders campaign it s transparent rhetoric meant to create a negative association this is alarming because not only is it yet another black mark on clintons unethical campaign and persona  its just stupid politics it alienates voters and further divides a party that wants to win the general incompetence of this level does nt deserve to be rewarded in the internet age

0,perhaps this is a reminder of what may happen when we expand government to do  everything   little considering that taxpayers do nt have enough money for  everything  i wonder what the city  county  and national governments associated with flint have spent on projects over the last 20 years that were less important than replacing lead pipes that bring water into people s homes  or understanding that the chemistry of drinking water is indeed important when lead pipes are still extant you can try to make this a democrat  republican  liberal  conservative issue  but it s really a demonstration of how government systems can go wrong when the servants of the people lose interest in their service  and the people lose sight of demanding government do basic things before it starts doing political things

0,disclaimer  i think obama should nominate someone  and the senate should hold confirmation hearings but this article does not accurately describe most republicans  statements on this issue  the vast majority of republican statements  although  notably  not the cruz one cited in the article  carefully phrase the issue as whether a nominee has been  nominated and confirmed  in the president s last year in office  although kennedy was confirmed in 1988  he was nominated by reagan at the end of 1987  so he does nt fall under this definition

0,i support sanders and it s a valid comparison they are both grassroots movements driven by frustration with the party establishment which are trying to steer the party to a less watered down version of what it claims to support they both have a more raw presentation which ignores the unspoken rules of what is okay to talk about they obviously have differences but from the high level  they are similar

0,really  either he s retiring or he s not up for reelection for a while 
0,it will be very interesting how this whole thing shakes out i saw an article about rand paul saying that obama has a conflict of interest in appointing a sc nominee since many of the cases the scotus will be reviewing are dealing with which powers the president does and does not have obama will pick someone who has similar views to himself  but it will be interesting to see what their thoughts on presidential powers is

0,that s what happens when you create stuff like dhs and use the patriot act to crush our rights 
0,the fact that senate republicans will attempt to block an obama nominee is no surprise what is surprising is the assertion that he should nt even attempt to replace justice scalia  even though he has nearly a year left in office it s as though somehow that would be unseemly to leave the supreme court without a tie breaking vote until 2017 is not in the best interest of the country 
0,this is literally one of the things i specifically voted for 
0,gt  senate inaction likely means the court will be without one justice for two terms the next supreme court term will be nearly half over when the next president is sworn in  and even if that president nominates quickly  confirmation is unlikely before the term  s end that means two years of potential 44 deadlocks that leave the court unable to decide major constitutional issues thus refusing to even vote on a nominee is not just an abdication of constitutional duty  it will manufacture a constitutional crisis  this should be the lede senate inaction could split the court 44 for the 20152016 term and the 20162017 term sitting on this nomination means it ll be   october of 2018   before the court opens a term with a full bench 
0,reps are inna pickle  they either scorch earth obama s pick and bet they get the wh next year  or hedge and comprimise on a moderate obama may slip a more moderate person in if they hedge their bets  but where it s going either  next dem inserts way more liberal that obamas pick or  r  win the wh and can put a conservative judge in  but that is in turn  betting on trump s continued koolaid wallsmashing rise to the presidency  so i got ta ask em do you feel lucky 
0,if the late justice had died on january 15th of next year  ok  they might have a point at that point it s a week until inauguration  nothing s going to get done in that time  but it would be classy to consult with his successor to get the process started a week sooner  but cmon guysinauguration is 11 12 months away insisting on it now is just plain childish 
0,appoint and nominate do nt mean the same thing 
0,regardless of your liberalconservative views  one of the main reasons supreme court justices have lifetime appointments is so that they may adjudicate  free from political influence this whole debate that is currently raging was never supposed to have occurred in the first place as the nominee is supposed to be someone who is the most qualified for the job in both the eyes of the president and the senate conservative or liberal  it was nt supposed to matter 
0,suppose that the gop wins the presidency but the democrats recapture the senate does anyone really think that if the democrats vote down every nominee for 4 years that the republicans will just say   well  that s just the senate doing their constitutional duty to advise and consent boy this is hard  i hope we can find a reasonable agreement on a suitable replacement   hell no  they would rage out  part of why our political system mostly works in this country is that for over 200 years even bitter rivals have been able to act in a manner which reflects respect for civic duty when that broke down once before  more than 600000 people died to resolve the dispute  if the senate does nt consider nominees to the supreme court in good faith  they risk the entire political system crashing down civil wars have been fought over less than this 
0,whether or not you are a fan of president obama  it is his responsibility to present a nominee to fill the vacancy a full year without even a name provided would be gross negligence on his part  imho there are good  qualified candidates for the position and there are issues that need to be adjudicated without danger of a 44 nondecision

0,actually  we had elections in 2010  2012 and 2014  they resulted in the currently republican held senate  who has to confirm anyone obama might nominate

0,this is nt the same thing bill and hillary are married i assume probably met doing something politically active  and they grew together and nurtured each other s careers it s not surprising that both of them would dedicate their lives to politics and potentially both reach the top  the bushes  on the other hand  are related by blood  not by common interest in that case it s more like a hereditary ruler  what the op means by  close family member 
0,let s be real  george washington would be sickened by this bullshit the man left office after two terms for a reason 
0,eli5  we specifically wrote into the system that a president ca nt serve more than two terms and that after those terms they re still ineligibleforlife for several nonpresidential positions  why is nt there anything about a single familybloodline being ineligible for at least a decent handful of generations after holding the office  it seems like the exact thing that would have been on the founders minds considering they were separating themselves from a country using a monarchy

0,you did nt say it in your dream  carson you said it out loud on front of everyone you are awake this is the real life you were nt supposed to say it out loud 
0,this is such an obvious thing it almost has to go without saying if there was a republican president  the debate would ve gone like this   should president republican nominate a replacement justice   and then every candidate would ve said   of course  that s what the constitution says  if the democrats try to block the nomination they re clearly trying to impede democracy there s historical precedent of nominating justices  there s so much hypocrisy in modern politics it s disgusting at least admit that you only want obama to wait because he s not going to nominate a judge you agree with 
0,gt  carson said the supreme court has become a  political tool   adding that it might be time to look at term limits for the justices   when we enacted that program  the average age of death was 47 and now it  s 80 you know  things have changed  so we need to change with them   carson said  i m confused is ben carson making a well reasoned argument 
0,carson surprised me for once 
0,this precedent the gop speaks of  does not exist   http  wwwscotusblogcom201602supremecourtvacanciesinpresidentialelectionyears  
0,carson said something not crazy 
0,am i wrong or did they choose that photo as an homage to the kermit meme 
0,carson woke up just long enough to make a valid point but by the time the last word left his lips his eyes had returned to their familiar glazed appearance 
0,gt  then again  recognize that the two picks that the president has selected are ideologues  so there  s really no reason to believe that his next pick wouldn  t be an ideologue also  a  we d have to go back to anthony kennedy probably to find a supreme court nominee who was nt an ideologue  and even then  most were surprised kennedy s voting record turned out to be moderate  b  the president has nt picked yet therefore no one knows if this pick  who does not yet exist  is an ideologue  or not no one knows who it is  no one has had a chance to examine the person s record no one has had a chance to interview the person and to find out their thoughts and positions  basically  obama could pick someone so conservative that they make scalia seem like a bleedingheart liberal  and the republicans would still be opposed no on substance  but because its obama s pick they are opposed to everything obama does because obama did it they disagree with much of what obama does for substantive reasons  of course  but with all of it for the childish reason of trying to prevent obama from doing anything at all  even when they agree with him 
0,i respect him for being honest about this are we really expecting politicians to lie to us  that s terrible

0,i just want to say that this thumbnail is perfect 
0,does anyone else find it ironic that scalia would not agree with limiting terms of justices as carson throws out at the end 
0,i think most recognize he is allowed to nominate but the senate is still allowed to deny it
0,aw shit it must be the end times  because i agree with everything ben carson said in that article

0,thank you  captain obvious 
0,i see they forgot to keep drugging his coffee 
0,of course is this really not common knowledge  do people really not realize it s an attempt to let a republican president nominate someone 
0, sips coffee  but thats none of my business 
0,he s entirely right  the only reason that republicans are complaining about obama being able to appoint a nominee for justice is because they fear that he ll pick someone that they do nt like  the republicans all agree that obama is  undermining the constitution   those are words taken straight from marco rubio s mouth   but when he has a  constitutional duty  to perform  they scream  he s gon na pick someone we do nt like  he should nt obey the law   hippocracy at its best 
0,of course not it s all posturing
0,lucid dreaming ftw 
0,scalia relied on textualism and originalism on the bench republicans loved him then  ben carson  who is seeking the republican nomination  says  things change  we should change with them  wut happen 2 originalism ben

0,why is he still running  he obviously does nt care about his image in the party anymore 
0,no one actually cares  no republican  be they voter or legislator  gives a shit about whether there s precedent for stalling like this  and most of them are nt even pretending to does it prevent obama from achieving his agenda  then they re for it it s that simple

0,the real question is  how did the reporter manage to get a full quote  every single reporter who has interviewed carson dozed off half way into the first sentence 
0,not only did he call the gop a bunch of hypocrites  but he also put forth an argument against the whole conservative ideology at the end lol 
0,wait did fucken ben carson have a moment of lucidity and logic  something grounded in reality and an analysis of the situation argued from logos instead of ethos  holy fucken shit 
0,and democrats would stonewall the fuck out of them  what else is new 
0,i m pretty sure carson does nt know what the word ideologue means 
0,of course they are the reality is that the more latinos and blacks learn about sanders  the more likely they will vote for him the only hurdle for them is awareness sanders  policies will make their lives better  period clinton s policies will just be the same old dc bullshit would you choose a better life or a shit life

0,gt  debunked this assertion with data showing that fewer than 1 in 10 abortion providers are in majorityblack neighborhoods the black population is largely concentrated into fairly tight areas  and make up less than 12  of the us population it would be interesting to see what percentage of black people as a whole have an abortion clinic in their zip code  zip was what was used in this  study   vs white people  to be a majority black neighborhood there would have to be quite a few black people there since their usage means that black people made up of 50  or more of the neighborhood  it could be 49  black  48  hispanic and they would nt consider it  majority black

0,does anyone know if conservatives  particularly republicans in the south  have some kind of more subtle agenda  s  beneath the veneer of  prolife  and  limited government   attempts to impede women s access to care in 2016 is so absurd that i often wonder if the motivations are deeper than just ignorancesexismracism  religion  and political ideology the ultimate consequences of interfering with women s health rights are so obviously ass backwards and to the detriment of society it makes my head explode  it would nt surprise me if many of these bastard politicians view such actions as a long term investment in their criminal justice systems and keeping their prisons filled  among other sinister motives  do these states  by chance  happen to reap any federal benefits from rampant populations growth  i know many red states get heavy federal subsidies it feels like there s more to it than concern for the  sanctity of life   perhaps i underestimate racism in the south 
0,funny  the only time i have personally heard the claim that planned parenthood was a conspiracysecret genocide of black people was from a professor that focused on black studies and who was herself black i also got to know a student who looked up to said professor as a mentor they both shared some of the most backwards  fuckedup  blmesque stances i have ever seen  this is not a conservative or liberal issue it s a misinformation issue people either make shit up to get what they want or they never bother finding out what s true or false before spouting shit to get what they want all dishonest sides will pull the same trick they want to break you down into groups so you re easier to control you can put any spin on any issue if you do nt care about the truth  here we see someone making an issue black and white while pretending to want to stop the issue from being black and white it is insane we have reached the point we have in politics everyone is contradicting themselves constantly the truth is the last thing they consider  i think the congresswoman made good points  and a gray stance would not bait as many clicks  but she is feeding the fire in her own way it is hypocritical and exhausting to see every day

0,so i m assuming he s going to nominate someone that the senate has already confirmed for another position  eg  judge sri srinivasan  etc   it s hard for the senate to say someone is nt qualified when they just recently confirmed that same person  unanimously   as they did with srinivasan 970 this also makes me think that it s  not  going to be attorney general loretta lynch  since her confirmation was more of a battle  edit   here is a list   https  enwikipediaorgwikilist_of_federal_judges_appointed_by_barack_obama  of federal judges obama has appointed so far during his presidency as you can see  several of them were unanimously confirmed by the senate

0,does anyone believe that hilary clinton was not going to run for president 
0,let s talk about how secretary of state was too much for her and had her contemplating leaving politics multiple times 
0,staaahhhhhp
0,does nt this simply show that people are willing to pay a lot of money to hear hillary s views  and that wall street has a lot of respect for her global perspective  regardless of her policy proposals   i know it s easy to paint her as prowall street for this  but getting paid for a speech is far from lobbying for wall street or being  bought and paid for  anyone familiar with her platform would know that  i would be more skeptical if she spoke for free

0,what happens when everybody figures out the banks are not the economy 
0,i am learning so much about who i do nt like on my own team this election season 
0,i support sanders and it s a valid comparison they are both grassroots movements driven by frustration with the party establishment which are trying to steer the party to a less watered down version of what it claims to support they both have a more raw presentation which ignores the unspoken rules of what is okay to talk about they obviously have differences but from the high level  they are similar 
0,in fairness  before the tea party was coopted by fox news and freedomworks  it actually did have a legitimate grassroots origin which was born of   some   of the similar frustrations that sander s supporters are expressing now in this way the origins are not entirely dissimilar  what   i   think is amusing is that bill clinton is trying to smear sanders by comparing his supporters to a  successful  movement much as people may hate to admit it  the tea party completely changed the political landscape  and not just in dc  so i think the message is clear  folks former president bill clinton is telling sanders supporters that they too can change the entire political landscape   billisaberniebro
0,i do nt think that denigrating sanders supporters will prove to be a winning move for the clintons if hillary s supporters had half the passion as they do her campaign probably would nt be so nervous  in reality  i see huge differences between the sanders movement and the tea party the tea party was manufactured by fox news and freedomworks to serve the establishment s purpose whereas the sanders movement is a true grassroots movement against politics as usual night and day difference 
0,gt  he added that the democratic party is experiencing a pull to the left similar to the extreme right pull exerted on the republican party by the tea party  the irony is that the dnc pulled hard to the right beginning with his second term if anything  i see this is a selfcorrection  in fairness  he never said that sanders supporters are like the tea party  but he did make allusions to that effect  and  before i am blasted  i m a sanders supporter 
0,i know its intended to be a jab  but the tea party has been very effective at getting their vocal minority into a number of local and state positions 
0,more and more  i wonder if bill is not looking forward to living in the white house again  especially if he does nt get to have the oval office  he s been doing his  open mouth  insert foot  routine for a few days now 
0,they say things like this because they are desperate to hold power attack  attack  attack desperate that is the clinton way it s disturbing that anyone would support this family people that desperate for power should never be allowed to have it i ve asked people to explain why they support hillary the answer  because republicans that s it bernie is simply a superior candidate in the face of that truth  you attack and hope something sticks may the entire clinton family fade to a footnote 
0,thanks for lumping me in with the sarah palinmichelle bachmannted cruz sycophants bill 
0,also had interesting words to say about obama in 2008  gt   a few years ago  this guy would have been carrying our bags 
0,i m surprised people are arguing with this  i would ve thought the similarities to the tea party were obvious if anything  bernie is turning out to be more successful than the tea partiers were  he is challenging the party establishment  claiming that they are not representing the interests of a big portion of their constituents  and calling for change their tactics are pretty much the same  only the issues are different 
0,solid move  if your intention is to fuck up at everything 
0,he s not wrong the tea party movement was pretty successful and put people in office 
0,bill clinton started us out on the proverbial road to ruin with his thirdway  republicanlite shit policies  and now his wife wants to finish the job no thanks 
0,fair comparison  bernie supporters are very grass roots  however  i would say they are the antitea party 
0,now now bill  i have nt seen a sanders supporter with  a factually contradictory sign that betrays their lack of understanding of the issues   https  wwwgooglecomsearch  q  keepgovernmentoutofmymedicareamp  biw  1390amp  bih  770amp  source  lnmsamp  tbm  ischamp  sa  xamp  sqi  2amp  ved  0ahukewixiyr12_zkahvesimkhbilacgq_auibigb 
0,he s not wrong just because his last name is clinton  guys  he s 100  right this is absolutely the left s tea party moment 
0,in a way  bernie supporters are like the tea party citizens who are fed up with status quo party politics organizing to elect individuals that will change their party the difference is ideology 
0,he s not wrong half the people on this subreddit list trump as their second choice for president 
0,this is just crazy  bernie fans are ideological purists  fighting against a democrat in name only  dino   and trying to purge the establishment from dc  the tea party are ideological purists  fighting against a republican in name only  rino   and trying to purge the establishment from dc  big difference 
0,let me say that i certainly hope so  the tea party has completely taken over control of the gop to such an extent that the party establishment can no longer dictate to them with absolute authority  let s also take a moment to remind everyone that the tea party during it s inception was made and built by ron paul and his supporters it was nt until later that the movement was hijacked by a torrent of koch money and became simply an outcry of  boo obama   seeing as bernie s army puts corrupting money at spot  1 as far as problems go that s one we likely wo nt see 
0,whatever anyone thinks of the tea party  it s a simple fact that they ve done a decent job wresting control of their party back from the entrenched corporate interests that were attempting to dominate it or at least they were  and even now there s a weird combination of uneasy alliance vs power struggle going on  if we can do the same on the left  i ll be very happy 
0,i mean  we are both interested in politics i guess 
0,he is correct  in that the fact the tea party was a republican cashroots campaign that took over and radicalized republicans and got them participating in government if this is somehow a bad thing for democrats to emulate then i missed the memo stating the government is a representation of corporate interests and not a representation of the peoples interests  edited for clarity 
0,damnit bill  i thought we were cool 
0,bill is gon na hand this election to bernie 
0,well then it would be wise for democrats to fall in line would nt it  the tea party cost several representatives their jobs and fractured the republican party beyond repair  of course the tea party is just a front for monied interests to cripple the federal government  but i think my point still kind of stands 
0,the clintons seems to think that it matter more that you get something done no matter what the consequences are than to be principled and not pass conservative legislation for the republicans

0,nice try bill  maybe tomorrow s spitball claim will actually stick 
0,he is nt wrong bernie supporters often accuse her of not being a  true progressive   similar to how tea partiers primaried conservatives who they thought were rinos despite agreeing with them on most issues 
0,as far as i can tell they have nt been coopted by billionaires intent on fucking up america just yet 
0,bernie sanders supporters are increasingly becoming a liberal tea party a section of the democratic party unrelenting in its  extreme  principles  complete distrust of the current establishment  and a set of policy proposals which are outside the main stream of the democratic party  e  while bill clinton is trying to smear bernie sanders supporters i m not i just think he happens to be right whether that means sanders  unelectable  or if this is even a concern for his campaign remains to be seen

0,i did nt think it was possible  but i have less respect for bill with every detrimental comment he spews about bernie and his supporters he should realize he s going to need us if hillary somehow wins the nomination
0,go back to getting your dick sucked  bill
0,okay  bill clinton has jumped the fucking shark 
0,anybody who says  well i guess bills kind of right  the two movements are kind of similar in some respects  is missing the point  while bill is correct hes only trying to make a loaded point in an attempt to discredit the sanders campaign it s transparent rhetoric meant to create a negative association this is alarming because not only is it yet another black mark on clintons unethical campaign and persona  its just stupid politics it alienates voters and further divides a party that wants to win the general incompetence of this level does nt deserve to be rewarded in the internet age 
0,bill is shocked that progressives are trying to pull the democratic party back to the left after him and his third way democrats pulled it to the right  shocker

0,to be honest  if the bernie movement can bring as much change to the democratic party as the tea party brought to the gop  i will be happy hate their agenda  but they did drag the gop to the right and got their candidates elected

0,just some stuff about priorities usa action  1  the article identifies it as  hillary clinton s superpac  but that s not really that accurate they support clinton now  but they were setup as barack obama s  official  superpac for the 2012 election establishment gon na establish  2  superpacs do have to disclose donors   here s 2012 for obama   https  wwwopensecretsorgpacspacgave2php  cmte  c00495861amp  cycle  2012    here s 2016 for hillary   https  wwwopensecretsorgpacspacgave2php  cmte  c00495861amp  cycle  2016   big donors are mostly hollywood execs  soros gave a lot though he always does  then it s a pretty diverse mix  it s not like it says  goldman sachs  all the way down  however yeah it s fair to say  100000 donations aint coming from the middle class  not really trying to take a position  just wanted to share facts i thought pertinent 
0,if the campaigns are nt allowed to coordinate with the super pacs  then how could clinton even tell them to stop advertising 
0,well  if elected  she d be really  really tough on them  you ll see  really  really tough trust her

0,throughout time the most powerful people have been   bankers  people who own natural resources and means of production they have been fighting since the beginning of government regulation the left is funded by the banks  gs  lehman bros  chase  etc  and the right is funded largely by oil executives  we should just get rid of private banking 
0,she always says to point to examples where she gave out favors  but is nt the _lack_ of doing anything really a favor  sanders always points out how nobody has gone to jail after the crash  and they also happened to spend millions of dollars in dc as well

0,has anyone in the media called them out on this hypocrisy  first they said they were nt working with a superpac  a lie  they re coordinating with correct the record superpac  one of her at least 3 superpacs   secondly  they said the superpacs were to only help in the general election against the republicans and make a level playing field except now they re unleashed against bernie 
0,so now hillary wants a wall 
0,maybe that s why the media is all but dismissing it it would mess up her whole diversity argument 
0,i do nt know why they d panic in sc  unless internal polling shows a sure sanders win in nv and they re worried about sanders getting a bump from a nv win 
0,looooooooool  i love this  literally two posts above this one is a cnn link that says   in south carolina  big leads on both sides  so now is clinton really having a panic attack on sc or is the media lying to us  you decide 
0,well  bernie needs to win nevada or sc or else he s done for on super tuesday  so nevada is definitely his best chance

0,gt  recently  hillary clinton  s most prominent surrogate  former president bill clinton  told a rally of her supporters that he still considered himself to be the first black president  and that the human genome showed  we are all mixraced people   wait  did this actually happen  if so  how did that get under the radar

0,wanting to place an arbitrary limit on the size of financial institutions is one of the strangest ideas to gain mainstream acceptance in the field of economics  the problem is not that banks are too big  it s that they re too leveraged  given the networking effects involved in finance  having 10 overleveraged small banks may not be any better than having one big overleveraged bank it may actually be easier to regulate and monitor the big one 
0,this is called damage control banks and the fed know reform is coming it s better to control your own fate than let others do it for you 
0,there is only one issue i have with what he said and perhaps some on who has a higher degree in economics than i do can explain why i m wrong  i have a minor in economics but does nt increased capital requirements mean banks have much less money to lend thus reducing the amount of money in existence  in economic terms anyway  and thus inflating the value of the dollar  since there is less of it in circulation  causing exports to weaken and imports to strengthen and if my understanding serves one of the problems of the recession was that bank credit simply dried up would nt this idea lead to a similar thing happening  also how small are we talking of making these banks  because economies of scale are still important to keep in mind when redistributing the banking system 
0,holy hell  that s some serious mental gymnastics 
0,oh  so now we re listening to former goldman sachs employees and members of the fed  that s interesting 
0,you know sanders campaign is having an effect on this country from top to bottom when headlines like this start popping up try and imagine seeing a headline like this back in 2006  it sounds ridiculous to even think about 
0,but i thought kashkari was a goldmansachs shill s you can read his full remarks  here   https  wwwminneapolisfedorgnewsandeventspresidentsspeecheslessonsfromthecrisisendingtoobigtofail  gt  i believe we must begin this work now and give serious consideration to a range of options  including the following  breaking up large banks into smaller  less connected  less important entities  turning large banks into public utilities by forcing them to hold so much capital that they virtually can  t fail  with regulation akin to that of a nuclear power plant   taxing leverage throughout the financial system to reduce systemic risks wherever they lie 
0,pretty funny rpolitics is all over kashkari right now  but when he ran as a republican for governor of california back in 2014 he was labeled a shill and considered to be one of the worst men in california

0,i think it is pretty hilarious that this is being referred to as a  conservative seat  on the scotus that s not actually how that works 
0,the gop is putting their heads on blocks here ideally they get obama to nominate someone moderate then slow play until after the election if the dem wins they ratify obama s nom in a lame duck session if the republican wins they table the whole thing and their guy gets a pick  by outright refusing they open the door to obama not nominating anyone  or nominating a dream liberal who they ca nt support either way they look like the aholes who refused point blank before they knew what the offer was obviously this will be decided by the election  which is a startlingly democratic idea   i know obama should get this pick  but he really does nt have any leverage here  it s a political reality  what they should have done is suggest a dream nominee of their own an idea obama  or any president  could nt support then it s a dirty political fight on both sides and congress can play some offense during election season their is no rule that says they ca nt suggest a nominee

0,ok guys  i love bernie but this is a random unscientific online poll that is about as meaningful as a poll of reddit users 
0,i do nt know why clinton and her campaign believes that the south is going to be a safe haven for her  you see  the thing about southern democrats is that they share alot of thoughts and feelings with southern republicans that live all around them  every day  for their entire lives  if you keep on hearing and seeing people talk about how much they hate hillary clinton as southern democrats do when they re around southern republicans  some of that will eventually seep in 
0,so much innuendo so little facts why so coy  if you got something tell us this article is almost meta it s an article about how the writer might go get the sources and facts needed to write an actual article 
0,what a ridiculous piece of agitprop how hard have republicans tried over the years to get one of these laughable scandals to stick  i d at least like to see some originality this time around remember when she was accused of murdering vince foster  then when the obvious lack of evidence became undeniable it simply became another part of the elaborate conspiracy what is more believable  that no plausible reason for indictment exists or hilary is some kind of cartoonish supervillain who acts with impunity and controls the free world from the shadows  if you believe the latter  please also explain why she would want to run for president since she obviously has everything figured out already 
0,man the ny post really has it in for hillary 
0,it s the post never trust the post i do nt even like hillary clinton  but if you guys are at the point where the new york post  a murdoch owned tabloid  is considered a legitimate news source on clinton then there is something seriously wrong with you guys they ve been publishing unsubstantiated hit pieces against her for over 20 years  they are nt exactly unbiased 
0,this rpolitics browbeating is becoming really grating 
0,republicans were saying this about whitewater and cattle futures and travelgate over 20 years ago 
0,berine supporter here just came in to say   ny post  lol 
0,lolor it might just mean that  despite a concerted effort for 30 years to connect her from everything from murder to drug running  these are nt real issues 
0,it  might  also be reasonable to conclude that her not having been indicted is a sign she has nt broken any laws  you know  if you re posting fox news and ny post articles in support of your cause  it might be time to evaluate your course 
0,uhh i have a great idea  let s get ken starr back and give him unlimited power and tons of money to investigate endlessly and if he takes long enough maybe she will get caught having sex with an intern and all the little trolls can say  see i told you so  we always knew she did something  we just had to wait long enough for her to actually do it  gotcha  she s not my first choice for president but if she s so damn good at getting away with all the stuff she s been accused of for 30 years  then maybe she d make a tough and crafty president  in her absence i would nominate the following paragons of virtue  bob livingston  tom delay denny hastert scooter libby newt gingrich irancontra etcetc  yo investigate this  shit happens on both sides of the aisle but since the day bill clinton announced his first run for president  the republicans have redefined the term  witch hunt  if they were half as obsessive about fixing things  we d all be living in the  real  america we all deserve
0,hillary clinton has never broken a law is that the kind of person you want for president 
0,its weird to me that this is pretty high on rall but the comments unanimously think its bullshit 
0,oh my god the republicans used to be the worst when it came to slandering other candidates  but the democrats have now taken the cake

0,while i of course like the title  we should probably disregard nypost articles 
0,i ca nt pinpoint if but something looks different about herhttp  imgurcomkqgo1jr
0,maybe the author of this article could show an example of a crime worthy of indictment  and why hillary was nt prosecuted for it  seems to me there s ample political will to prosecute the clinton s for any wrongdoing from the right  so if there s sufficient evidence out there  why is nt it being acted upon  just reporting that other people say there s wrongdoing worthy of prosecution is nt  evidence  of anything other than what that person claimed if ken starr has evidence that a crime was committed twenty years ago  what s he been waiting for 
0,you know  if you re posting fox news and generating discussion and opinions based on faulty information

0,one problem that will need to be addressed before even mr sanders  economic prescriptions can work  our currency is overloaded  in a computer program  if the programmer tries to do too many things with one variable  the result is sure failure humans overload their currencies in the same way and to the same result  they try to make their currencies do too many things at the same time a medium of exchange  a medium of wealth storage  a means of demonstrating success  etc this can be fixed by using specific currencies for specific things  a saving currency  a trading currency  an investment currency  etc make tax policies specific to the uses of the various currencies and to their conversions from one type to another this would require secure electronic currencies  on a related note  what is a good way to really screw up a government  hoard their currency or otherwise take it out of circulation  the us and other governments are experiencing this now as multinational corporations stash currencies in outofreach banks governments are foolish to allow these people  aka  corporations   to undermine their currencies in this manner

0,either way the process will be dragged out until after the elections the gop have the votes in the senate to say no and would rather gamble in 2016 they at least had the decency to inform everyone of what exactly they re doing this time around 
0,disclaimer  i think obama should nominate someone  and the senate should hold confirmation hearings but this article does not accurately describe most republicans  statements on this issue  the vast majority of republican statements  although  notably  not the cruz one cited in the article  carefully phrase the issue as whether a nominee has been  nominated and confirmed  in the president s last year in office  although kennedy was confirmed in 1988  he was nominated by reagan at the end of 1987  so he does nt fall under this definition

0,kennedy having been nominated in 1987 to fill a vacancy created in 1987 a vacancy extended due to the rejection of robert bork for purely ideological reasons  got ta suspect a lot of rs remember that their sc nominees since bork almost always get hassled and delayed but the dem nominees got free rides this time around  why should they let a judge on the court that ll put a liberal majority on the court  it s not dems are gon na just let a president cruz appoint a conservative to replace ginsburg  this has all been building up for years since the dems stopped robert bork 
0,somehow i thought this would be about them working in place of strikers  the usual meaning of  cross the picket line  which i did think was an odd choice for s first date for anyone curious here is the full quote  from hillary  around which the article is based ethical or not  your choice  i m just providing the quote for those who do nt feel like clicking  gt  we both had wanted to see a mark rothko exhibit at the yale art gallery but  because of a labor dispute  some of the university s buildings  including the museum  were closed as bill and i walked by  he decided he could get us in if we offered to pick up the litter that had accumulated in the gallery s courtyard watching him talk our way in was the first time i saw his persuasiveness in action we had the entire museum to ourselves we wandered through the galleries talking about rothko and twentiethcentury art i admit to being surprised at his interest in and knowledge of subjects that seemed  at first  unusual for a viking from arkansas we ended up in the museum s courtyard  where i sat in the large lap of henry moore s sculpture drape seated woman while we talked until dark

0,the actual story here is pretty neat and only solidifies my affection for bill
0,this is a cool story they did nothing wrong it was a creative way to see some interesting art and  in bill s case  a way to impress the girl you like 
0,so bill clinton  as a college kid  conned his way into a museum and had it all to themselves  but this is now a story about how bill and hillary were scabs  and therefore can now be construed to be secretly antilabor  this fucking sub has lost all sense of perspective 
0,wow this is hilariously over the top a sweet anecdote about their first date is spun into a tale of antilabor scabs totally totally ridiculous  this hillarybashing is really getting embarrassing for the hillaryhaters

0,i loathe the clintons with the power of a thousand fiery suns  but i sometimes really appreciate ol  slick willie something else  that s for sure 
0,i was told to vote for this woman by my union  iam  but i voted for obama and i will vote for bernie this post leaves a really bad taste in my mouth what hypocrite s they are 
0,good for them  it s pretty amazing that people are upset that the clintons picked up litter that the people who were being paid to do so refused to do  it s like many people always say if they feel the compensation for the job is nt fair  quit and find a job that s more in line with what they feel they should be getting  if they ca nt find a job that pays what they think they are worth  perhaps they are overestimating the value of the skills they bring to the table  i m aware this article was submitted as an attack piece  but the story makes bill clinton look awesome 
0,this is in striking contrast to sanders who got arrested on his college campus for protesting segregation practices 
0,well they do nt have to do that anymore now they ll just get 600k for reading off a speech 
0,suckers  this one will be different  
0,tell me he is nt going to win  bullshit   
0,hillary would like to remind everyone that she is  very  experienced 
0,the fact that senate republicans will attempt to block an obama nominee is no surprise what is surprising is the assertion that he should nt even attempt to replace justice scalia  even though he has nearly a year left in office it s as though somehow that would be unseemly to leave the supreme court without a tie breaking vote until 2017 is not in the best interest of the country 
0,this is literally one of the things i specifically voted for 
0,gt  senate inaction likely means the court will be without one justice for two terms the next supreme court term will be nearly half over when the next president is sworn in  and even if that president nominates quickly  confirmation is unlikely before the term  s end that means two years of potential 44 deadlocks that leave the court unable to decide major constitutional issues thus refusing to even vote on a nominee is not just an abdication of constitutional duty  it will manufacture a constitutional crisis  this should be the lede senate inaction could split the court 44 for the 20152016 term and the 20162017 term sitting on this nomination means it ll be   october of 2018   before the court opens a term with a full bench 
0,reps are inna pickle  they either scorch earth obama s pick and bet they get the wh next year  or hedge and comprimise on a moderate obama may slip a more moderate person in if they hedge their bets  but where it s going either  next dem inserts way more liberal that obamas pick or  r  win the wh and can put a conservative judge in  but that is in turn  betting on trump s continued koolaid wallsmashing rise to the presidency  so i got ta ask em do you feel lucky 
0,if the late justice had died on january 15th of next year  ok  they might have a point at that point it s a week until inauguration  nothing s going to get done in that time  but it would be classy to consult with his successor to get the process started a week sooner  but cmon guysinauguration is 11 12 months away insisting on it now is just plain childish 
0,appoint and nominate do nt mean the same thing 
0,regardless of your liberalconservative views  one of the main reasons supreme court justices have lifetime appointments is so that they may adjudicate  free from political influence this whole debate that is currently raging was never supposed to have occurred in the first place as the nominee is supposed to be someone who is the most qualified for the job in both the eyes of the president and the senate conservative or liberal  it was nt supposed to matter 
0,suppose that the gop wins the presidency but the democrats recapture the senate does anyone really think that if the democrats vote down every nominee for 4 years that the republicans will just say   well  that s just the senate doing their constitutional duty to advise and consent boy this is hard  i hope we can find a reasonable agreement on a suitable replacement   hell no  they would rage out  part of why our political system mostly works in this country is that for over 200 years even bitter rivals have been able to act in a manner which reflects respect for civic duty when that broke down once before  more than 600000 people died to resolve the dispute  if the senate does nt consider nominees to the supreme court in good faith  they risk the entire political system crashing down civil wars have been fought over less than this 
0,whether or not you are a fan of president obama  it is his responsibility to present a nominee to fill the vacancy a full year without even a name provided would be gross negligence on his part  imho there are good  qualified candidates for the position and there are issues that need to be adjudicated without danger of a 44 nondecision 
0,meta comment  this fucking website sucks i m trying to read the article  and when i scroll down  it hijacks my browser to tell me that somehow i ve read  3 of 6 free articles   but if i want to continue to read this article  i need to put in my goddamn email address when i close the popup  it sends me to their home page  this is a master class in how to piss readers off  edit  oh jesus fuck i ve put in a spam email address now  and it says  thanks for signing up   but redirects me to another article when i hit the back button in the browser  i get the same behavior  enter your email address fuck the nation  edit 2  now  without reading any more articles  it says i m reading 5 of 6 free articles 
0,actually  we had elections in 2010  2012 and 2014  they resulted in the currently republican held senate  who has to confirm anyone obama might nominate 
0,we also had elections for congress and guess who won those  this is the kind of shit that happens when people only vote for president 
0,the president does not appoint justices he nominates  the senate approves or does nt approve 
0,and we chose who gets to affirm the choice when the senate was won by republicans in 2014 
0,i love how each party gets super butthurt when they are on the  other side of the coin   http  wwwcnsnewscomnewsarticleericscheinerschumer07weshouldnotconfirmanybushnomineesupremecourt   but are absolutely astonished at the disrespect when the same thing happens to them in the future

0,i m a big sanders supporter  but you got ta admit this was just clinton being smooth as fuck he sweettalked a curator and offered to pick up some litter so he could bring a date into an empty museum that is god damned romantic and in no way political 
0,really mods  come the fuck on now 
0,i legitimately ca nt decide which political move is more out of touch with reality  1 hillary boasting about having henry kissenger s support  2 jeb using george w on the campaign trail  it s madness it s absolute madness 
0,so this is just jeb s final hail mary move  right 
0,the other night trump was met which a chorus of boos for daring to challenge the conservative spin that  george w kept our country safe  trump pointed out that 911 occurred during the bush regime  despite warnings from the cia that this attack was imminent in a report titled   osama bin laden destined to strike in the united states  or something like that  trump also pointed out that bush s destabilizing influence is what created isis and emboldened terrorists in that destabilized region  which is also tantamount to not exactly keeping us safe  the howl of horrified boos from the audience was amazing  as though each of them was drinking the same koolaid
0,the really sad thing is that w looks like winston churchill compared to current crop of gop candidates
0,we need to dispel this notion that jeb bush knows what he s doing jeb bush has no fucking clue what he is doing 
0,jeb needs to get his mommy to help him campaign  and when that does nt work he calls in his brother who is nationally regarded as responsible for many of the problems we face as a country today  please clap 
0,jeb s mother told him to have george speak 
0,remember w was handed a surplus in 2001 and squandered it with incredibly irresponsible tax cuts during time of war the us is the only country in the history of the world to cut taxes during time of war conservatives have no standing to complain about the national debt because largely they caused it  now that we are in the paul ryan era  the budget deficit and national debt any more is absolutely intentional because they will use it to justify cuts in social security and medicare and anything else that does nt benefit the 1   it s the grover norquist method 
0,did you guys watch the speeches  i think it helped him people who do nt want anything to do with the bush family can snicker all they want  but it was definitely a plus for jeb bush has a 70  approval rating with republican voters it ll help with the nomination at least  w warmed up the crowd and jeb had a tough act to follow and it lit a flame jeb has never spoken with so much furor before it s a newer jeb  but probably too late to change much but  if jeb continues with the same confidence as yesterday he could climb to 2nd place rationally  in the very least it bought in the spotlight and people actually can hear about jeb s stance on things 
0,funny how the american media ca nt write stories like these but then  they would have to implicate themselves in absolute failure that was 43 s presidency 
0,i picture jeb  not wanting george to campain for him  but being to bashful to tell him 
0,you know it s bad when you re bringing in dubya to help out on the campaign trail 
0,it s also a reminder that the  burn it all down  mentality has its consequences people did protest votes against gore and the country has  in fact  burn to the ground in many respects a full  third  of our debt   66trillion  is from the bush tax cuts alone  and another 10    17trillion  is from the war in iraq we re looking at thousands dead and maimed servicemen and women and a foreign policy that has directly contributed to the rise of isis and islamic extremism in the middle east civil liberties have been rolled back with the usa patriot act  usa is part of the acronym   and bushappointed alito is practically trying to outcompete thomas for archconservative on the court  which gave us citizens united and nearly derailed the aca 
0,i saw this story in australia and thought  oh well if another bush gets in at least we might get four more years of quality punk songs after an eight year hiatus

0,anybody else watch the sean hannity interview with jeb  and george while thinking to themselves   thank god  yahweh  allah  shiva  buddha  zeus  odin  and anyone else listening that man is nt president anymore  
0,i really think it s time for the us to have more political parties it s pretty obvious that both republicans and dems are sick and tired of their own parties we got a guy who calls himself a socialist and a real estate tycoon reality show star as front runners time for a reality check 
0,of course he s going to support his brother it s crazy to think he would nt

0,obama looks at bush   it s not my fault  he roped me into it  bush looks at clinton   well he roped me into it  clinton plays his saxophonewearing a small badge that reads  first black president 
0,just to remind people what the george w bush presidency was really like  lie on top of lie  https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  yykc4gd2id4 also  the lehman brothers subprime mortgage scheme that drained  7t out of the us economy  sending the us into the great recession of 2008 was concocted early in the bush presidency  somebody will eventually write the true history and legacy of the bush family  from george hw bush to george w bush  and it will expose a family that very nearly destroyed the us 
0,i am not which president in my lifetime has a anything but a disastrous legacy even obama is nt going to be remembered fondly for some of the actions of the us during his presidency  if anything he seemed to double down on everything bush did wrong
0,i swear to god  barbara had to be smoking weed or eating lead paint chips while pregnant with those two w looks like he s got mange on the top of his head  and i love how laura just stands there next to him  without a clue  waving like a retard at everyone  she looks great by the way  regardless of what people try to say now  george w bush was one of the worst president s this country has ever had there s a mile long list of horrifically bad things his administration brought about  from 911 to the patriot act colin powell and rumsfeld were the only two competent people who came out of that administration  do nt forget  cheney created the nsa and the psychotic nsa contractor where the concept of ass raping and torturing innocent americans is somehow making us all safe 
0,7 years later  still blaming bush 
0,george w bush belongs in the hague  as do cheney and rumsfeld 
0,its his brother  its not surprising its like bill supporting hillary 
0,here a question for you would rather have uday or quesy running iraq after daddy saddam gets old and has heart attack like scalia 
0,one of the worst humans and presidents ever  what a total moron  thanks for destroying the lives of generations of americans 
0,umm  what does this have to do with how much hillary sucks and how awesome bernie is and how he s going to save america  stay on topic please

0,id love to hear trumps reaction 
0,close but no cigar bill
0,i might be going out on a limb here but maybe  just maaaaybe i am guessing that not many trump supporters are fond of obama so this will only be fuel for the donald to use in his next rally speech 
0,i think obama knows that there are a significant numbers of republicans that disagree with everything he says  and will thus continue to support trump  from the democrats  perspective  trump is the best gop candidate in the field because he is a wildcard and does nt follow the party line additionally  trump is not afraid to call out the gop s bullshit  even if trump does nt win the nomination  the longer he stays in  the more likely he is to damage the other candidates and the more likely he is to go 3rd party  obama plays chess the gop plays checkers 
0,this comment made by obama will only help trump because it elevated him above all the other opponents in south carolina obama basically recognized him as a front runner by making this statement 
0,what a great endorsement for trump bush and now obama attacking him just cements him as antiestablishment 
0, who s the president of the united states    ronald reagan   hah  an actor  then who s the vice president  jerry lewis

0,obama can be pretty savage 
0,funny considering between obama and trump  trump is the only one that has ever actually created a  serious job  or held one 
0,has obama ever even had a private sector job in his life 
0,why do pundits still say trump is nt  serious   trump clearly stands to benefit by winning  both in terms of his net assets and in terms of political power and prestige 
0,yep very serious you literally have to cry on camera to regain your failing support as president  obama just made trump the candidate probably will go up 5  in polls 10  nationally  thank you so much mr obama   yeah  i remember your campaign also mr obama  hope and change  marketing and selling but oh waityou also say that trump is just a great marketershow i dont understand mr obama  are you just a hypocrite  or a bit ignorant  or are you just being a political liar  i thank the sweet baby jesus obama just made trump the candidate because republicans dont like obama and many democrats also dont like obama blacks dont like obama  lol  now you bernie supporters just pray he keeps on kissing the bum of hillary 
0,i see what you did there barack  well played  well played 
0,has trump called him a stupid poopyhead yet 
0,it s pretty likely the gop will have trump as their candidate  and wwwfivethirtyeightcom have been saying so for a while  however  the dems should be peachy so long as they do nt have a farleft extremist as their candidate oh  wait 
0,sounds nervous     http  imgurcommqpnuof

0,jesus fucking christ they were nt going in as scab workers bill lied about cleaning up the place to get in so he could have an evening alone with his lady this is like a scene from a shitty romantic comedy  not some insightful view into the clinton s neocon leanings for fucks sake can we concentrate on actual fucking issues and not try to convince each other that america s most prominent family of civil servants is evil because their names are nt bernie and sanders

0,thank allah for donald trump 
0,i do not like hillary clinton but this shit is so fucking weak she is not riding on the coattails of her family she is not from a political family she and bill formed a partnership without this marriage does bill clinton ever become president  i do nt believe so hillary is not bill s child she is her own person a person who has worked hard to get where she is now stop equating her with the bushies there is no clinton dynasty at least not yet

0,how close can the bush brothers be  they do nt even have the same accent 
0,did we just get punked by the british   
0,and in a country that threw off kings and queens and inherited nobility  they can both shove it 
0,do nt forget bernie s uncle  colonel 
0,this is nt the same thing bill and hillary are married i assume probably met doing something politically active  and they grew together and nurtured each other s careers it s not surprising that both of them would dedicate their lives to politics and potentially both reach the top  the bushes  on the other hand  are related by blood  not by common interest in that case it s more like a hereditary ruler  what the op means by  close family member 
0,let s be real  george washington would be sickened by this bullshit the man left office after two terms for a reason 
0,eli5  we specifically wrote into the system that a president ca nt serve more than two terms and that after those terms they re still ineligibleforlife for several nonpresidential positions  why is nt there anything about a single familybloodline being ineligible for at least a decent handful of generations after holding the office  it seems like the exact thing that would have been on the founders minds considering they were separating themselves from a country using a monarchy 
0,our government has basically been a twofamily system  not just a twoparty system it shows how undemocratic our democracy really is

0,  stop the presses  
0,this article hits at my major reservation with clinton i do nt doubt her capability  i doubt her commitment to addressing of the concerns of my generation much of what young voters want is at odds with the clintonian  new democrats    third way  political triangulation 
0, in truth  our affluent  establishment democrats can no more be budged from their core dogmas  that education is the solution to all problems  that professionals deserve to lead  that the downfall of the working class is the inevitable price we pay for globalization  than creationists can be wooed away from the tenets of  intelligent design  
0,not bad for theguardian i like the last bit about the dogma of the left   education is the solution to all problems   not when preaching the wrong thing  edit  which was what the article was getting at  il admit i spedread
0,this  and another article  really describe to me the difference between clintonera thought and sanders thought clinton economics is to have unfettered capitalist coupled with biggovernment welfare in the form of transfer payments to those harmed by capitalism sanders favors a more fair form of capitalism that is restrained  designed to not allow people to become billionaires instead of transfer payments funded by taxes  he would rather see more opportunities with their cost baked into the pricing of goods and services  i prefer the sanders approach because it is tenable everyone hates high taxes to fund welfare payments it is better to put more people to work with an economy that is designed to do this rather than one designed to make a few people insanely rich 
0,if the democrats were against inequality  they would nt have given the shareholders of major financial corporations billions of dollars in free money over the past 8 years 
0,gt  that the downfall of the working class is the inevitable price we pay for globalization this is clinton s ethos so sorry  working class  but your suffering and futility is the price so that we can have our multinationals and cheap consumer shit but we all know  the elite are the real victims of globalization they get to see their fellow citizens suffer and die and it s the elite that has to deal with that burden 
0,so if republican establishment serves the 1  and democrat establishment serves the 10   1  inclusive   that leaves the 90  without any representation sounds like a cause for revolution to me it s just a republicrat money grab and some of you have been fooled to think it s different 
0,funny how truth is self evident wherever you find it 
0,education is the solution of draining money from the poor in order for a few of them to be considered for the job of becoming corporate slaves 
0,you do realize that obama s new deal spent more than the new deal 
0,we did nt want obama to approach this job as a cynic  by now he has earned it while most have gotten frustrated watching it  this has been his entire waking life for over 7 years i would like to hear his commentaries of the process once he no longer has to keep decorum  this likely wo nt change  no matter who gets in each and every presidential contender left has pissed off a large number of people within the gop trump  rubio  jeb  and cruz are just as likely to be labeled the antichrist as sanders and hillary

0,did nt obama also take part in obstructing the approval of a bush scotus nominee 
0,everyone say it with me    elections have consequences 
0,i personally have completely become accustomed to it i expect them to obstruct just about every thing that touches the left half of the spectrum  and so far  they have 
0,what chaps my ass is mr obama did nt say this five years ago  when the pattern was already well established 
0, well  at least they re not filibustering to keep the other party s majority from voting   http  articleschicagotribunecom20060130news0601300193_1_filibusterjudgealitoconfirmation 
0,he should know what he s talking about  since he joined john kerry in 2006 to filibuster george w bush s nomination of samuel alito to the supreme court 
0,yea  you almost have go back 2 whole years when the dems were in charge and harry reid would not even allow gop amendments to be voted on 
0,yeah well welcome to a 2 party system

0,oh ya  lets just pretend the dems did nt do the exact same thing when bush was in office 
0,hah  says the guy who has  himself  filibustered a scotus appointment 
0,shit  the dems would do the same thing both parties have to go 
0,dragging ass is only going to hurt the republicans with moderates and undecideds in the general election 
0,man those checks and balances of power in the constitution are a real downer 
0,this is a consequence of changing how the senators are elected it used to be that the house of representatives  and to some extent it is still called this   called the  people s house  basically  the senators used to be appointed by the states  and that was changed in the early part of last century  which puts a different kind of pressure on the senators to be as partisan as the house has always been 
0,we ve almost become accustomed to how obstructionist both parties can be with us stuck in the middle if only there were third parties and better voting systems to more accurately represent us 
0,we have three branches in order to separate powers this is part of it people act like this is something new the legislative branch  republican  is going to fight to leverage power from the executive branch  democrat  by trying to get more conservatives into the judicial branch a democratcontrolled senate would do the same to a republican president if roles were flipped and rbg s spot became available 
0,i m probably going to be shouted down for this  but i have to say  it s not congress s job to enable the president s agenda it is rather the president s job to faithfully execute the laws congress passes  if it decides to pass any so  yes  they ve obstructed his goals in office  but that s their prerogative likewise  while you and i may dislike it  if congress decides to attempt to hamper his goals in whatever ways its powers allow it to  that s part of the checks and balances present in the constitution  there s no clause in there saying   but if congress  really  wo nt play ball and you  really  want to do something  ignore them and do it anyway  that being said  he is free to tell them they are assholes if he wishes  honestly  i m happy to see a relatively inactive congress the us code is long enough

0,the dnc is in a tight spot they ve put a lot of time  money  and effort into clinton  and are now increasingly willing to send good money after bad if they think that there s still a chance that they can pull clinton out of her nosedive to get her the nomination  they can similarly delude themselves into thinking that  by the general  the email thing will have blown over  especially if clinton herself has not been candid with the democratic leadership about what was on that system because  she  believes that they will have no choice but to back her if she can get the nomination  do nt operate under the assumption that just because the dnc establishment wants hillary as the nominee and hillary wants the support of the dnc that either trusts the other  honestly  one of the more damning things for clinton was the house gop taking a step back and just saying   you know what  we think the fbi s got this covered 
0,her supporters have admitted as such by saying there is no way the administration would prosecute if a crime is determined to have been committed and no charges are brought  that s the definition of protection

0,i love arguing politics with coworkers
0,gt  the group s voter guide would probably pass muster in the precitizens united days  says larry noble  a lawyer for campaign legal center and former general counsel for the federal election commission  so the article is saying that  citizens united  has very little to do with this ability to essentially endorse candidates  before  citizens united   there was nothing wrong with a corporation saying  hillary clinton hates puppies   because the law drew a line at  hillary clinton hates puppies and you should nt vote for her  i m not really sure that makes a huge difference

0,keep just these recent decisions in mind where justice scalia was a part of the 54 majority that could have different outcomes if he is replaced by a democrat president   in a 54 majority limits in mccutcheon v fec  the court invalidated the aggregate contribution limits that were first put in place by the federal election campaign act of 1971   in atamp  t mobility v concepcion  the 54 majority ruled that corporations can effectively mandate arbitration agreements that preclude consumers from bringing class actions to combat fraud and enforce their rights without access to an impartial judge and jury  and without the resources to go it alone in arbitration  people typically abandon their claims and corporate wrongdoers are never held accountable many states enacted consumer protection laws to curtail the pernicious practice of forced arbitration  but in concepcion the supreme court held that such laws are preempted by an old federal statute from 1925 called the federal arbitration act  faa    the 54 majority in michigan v epa overturned epa regulations safeguarding communities from toxic pollution by power plants that causes up to 11000 premature deaths each year essentially  the court  s decision places a premium on businesses  bottom lines over public health and limits the epa  s ability to regulate hazardous air pollutants over the objections of corporate interests   in ledbetter v goodyear tire and rubber co  the 54 court majority made it virtually impossible to bring a claim of longrunning sex or race discrimination in pay under title vii of the 1964 civil rights act  a decision later reversed by a congressional statute a woman had been paid less than her male peers for 20 years and the court stated she had no right to bring a lawsuit for equal pay because she failed to file suit within 180 days of the first discrimination  even though she had no way of learning about the discrimination until years later   in davis v fec  a 54 majority overturned the  millionaire  s amendment   congress  s effort to level the playing field in the political process and reduce the influence of wealth on elections by increasing the contribution limits to candidates facing selffunded opponents   in florence v board of chosen freeholders  the 54 court majority ruled that local officials can stripsearch anyone accused of any crime  even if there is no reason to suspect contraband or concealed weapons  and can not be sued for invasion of privacy   the 54 majority in shelby county v holder overturned a key section of the 1965 voting rights act  making it much harder to protect against discrimination in voting not only did the majority dismissively reject tens of thousands of pages of congressional findings supporting the coverage formula contained in section 4 of the nearlyunanimous 2006 reauthorization of the vra  but the opinion was noted for failing to provide any legal or constitutional rationale for its holding nothing in the text of the constitution was cited to justify the court  s novel decision to strike down the cornerstone of american civil rights law   the 54 majority in leegin creative leather products inc v psks inc overruled a 96yearold rule that had made vertical price fixing per se illegal under federal antitrust law overturning the almost century of antitrust law  the court decided that manufacturers and retailers could sometimes engage in pricefixing in dissent  justice breyer cited studies estimating that this change in law would cost consumers  300 billion a year in increased prices on everyday items   a 53 majority  since justice sotomayor recused herself  in american express co v italian colors restaurant ruled that a smallbusiness owner could not bring an antitrust lawsuit challenging a large corporation  s alleged abuse of its monopoly power  even though  it was claimed  it was that very monopoly power that allowed the corporation to force an agreement to arbitrate and not litigate all complaints against it the court upheld the use of forced arbitration clauses even if it made enforcing federal laws like the sherman act practically impossible in dissent  justice kagan explained that the court  s decision allows   t  he monopolist    to use its monopoly power to insist on a contract effectively depriving its victims of all legal recourse   the 54 majority in burwell v hobby lobby stores  inc decided that forprofit corporations can claim religious rights and can exempt themselves from federal laws requiring them to provide contraceptive coverage to employees the majority also rewrote the religious freedom restoration act  with potentially dangerous consequences for lgbt and other americans   in parents involved in community schools v seattle school district  the 54 court majority prohibited school districts from attempting voluntarily to promote school desegregation through student reassignment plans   in walmart v dukes  approximately one million female walmart employees tried to file a classaction lawsuit over claims of sex bias the 54 decision by the court made it nearly impossible for a class of workers to use for widespread corporate misbehavior that comes in the form of unwritten policies essentially  every worker has to bring their own individual claim  making walmart and other large companies realistically judgment proof to these types of claim   in two 54 decisions  solid waste agency of northern cook county v us army corps of engineers and rapanos v united states  the court effectively took many waterways outside the protection of the clean water act  even though pollution from these waterways can dirty the drinking water of 117 million americans as a result of the court  s decision  1500 major pollution investigations have been halted  and epa actions against water polluters have fallen by 50    in national federation of independent business v sebelius which upheld the patient protection and affordable care act under the taxing power of congress  a 54 majority on the court overturned 70 years of precedent dealing with the commerce clause prior to this case  the court had held that congress has the authority to regulate activities that have a substantial effect on interstate commerce in the area of economic activities   substantial effect  can be found based on the cumulative impact of the activity across the country for example  the supreme court held that congress could use its commerce clause authority to prohibit individuals from cultivating and possessing small amounts of marijuana for personal medicinal use because marijuana is bought and sold in interstate commerce the relationship between health care coverage and the national economy is even stronger and more readily apparent the court had also said that congress could use its commerce power to forbid hotels and restaurants from discriminating based on race  even though their conduct was refusing to engage in commercial activity under an unbroken line of precedents stretching back 70 years  congress has the power to regulate activities that  taken cumulatively  have a substantial effect on interstate commerce people not purchasing health insurance unquestionably has this effect this ruling  if a liberal justice is replaced with someone like scalia  could overturn vast amounts of social programs like medicare and worker protections  on the other hand  occasionally a justice like justice kennedy has sided with the liberal justices to produce 54 decisions that would be in danger if a republican wins the white house and a liberal justice dies or retires while they are in office   in obergefell v hodges  a 54 court majority ruled that the constitution protects the right of samesex couples to marry   a 54 majority in texas department of housing and community affairs v the inclusive communities project upheld the longstanding interpretation of the federal fair housing act to prohibit practices with unjustified discriminatory impact   in massachusetts v epa  a 54 court majority upheld the authority of the epa to regulate greenhouse gases   a 54 majority upheld voterpassed nonpartisan redistricting reform in arizona state legislature v arizona independent redistricting commission   in williamsyulee v the florida bar  a 54 majority upheld a ban on state judicial candidates directly soliciting campaign funds   in boumediene v bush  a 54 majority ruled that prisoners detained in guantanamo can file habeas corpus petitions to challenge their detention   a 54 majority in alabama democratic conference v alabama invalidated a state redistricting scheme that used race to harm minority voters   a 54 majority ruled in favor of workers  rights in csx transportation v mcbride ruling railroads are liable for workers  injuries under federal statute if the railroad was partially responsible for the injury through its negligence

0,to be fair al gore came to my town  that is in the netherlands  last year to speak they paid him   150k iirc  i did nt go  tickets were quite expensive but i was pretty shocked how much some people get paid for a less than two hour speech
0,since when does the secretary of state has to deal with breaking banks or not 
0,so we ve moved on to supposition articles now 
0,if he had clinton s resume and was nt trying to dismantle the banking system  absolutely it s not like she was the only person they paid to speak they had an entire speaker series featuring successful people from diverse backgrounds 
0,secretary of state is foreign policy  she was nt the damn secretary of treasury  holy hell the misinformation and bad thought processes
0,the secretary of state is being taken to task for notbreaking up domestic banks  this is officially the dumbest anticlinton thing on rpolitics this week 
0,absolutely you are out of your minds if you think bankers are nt going to want to hear the outgoing treasury secretary speak 
0,i am fairly certain that if bernie sanders had been treasury secretary  that he would have been courted for speeches to banking events no matter what type of policy he had 
0,if goldman sachs is run by  say  surly junior high kids or ted cruz  yeah  i would nt pay to hear from enemies  if  however  i wanted to get a perspective of someone who did  indeed  regulate my business and lower my profit margin  i would want hear from them i would want to know their unvarnished perspective as the winner  in order to alter my strategy this is because i m a grownup  this does nt have anything to do with hilary  just that the premise of the title assumes that fifth graders run the world which  granted  may be true 
0,no  a bank would nt want someone who s actively trying to stop them from profiting so handsomely speaking at their institution  because you know exactly what a bernie speech to goldman sachs would sound like 
0,this speaking program is not some big secret you can go  look at their website   http  wwwgoldmansachscomourthinkingtalksatgs  for lots of information the point  according to one redditor who worked at a big bank  is simply  getting famous people to draw potential clients   https  npredditcomrpoliticscomments45xcbkwhile_clinton_and_many_on_the_left_decryd00xb90  context  3   the speakers are famous people of all stripes  prominent athletes  scientists  retired military  entrepreneurs  russel simmons  dean kamen   the archbishop of canterbury  etc  there are some leftyoutsider people too such as amory lovins and linda hirshman  but in general not that many are politicians because not that famous 
0,not a fan of hilary and do nt believe she has any desire to be super tough against big moneycorporationsbanks or whatever  but her job as secretary of state had nothing to do with the economy 
0,gt  if this sounds strange  let s imagine a slightly different scenario suppose bernie sanders had spent four years in president obama s cabinet during which time he did everything he could to try to break up the big banks and have corporate criminals put behind bars does anyone believe goldman sachs would pay him  250000 to recount his experiences  yes 
0,yes hillary clinton completely failed in her capacity as secretary of the treasury jesus fucking christ guys  quit shoving this shit down my throat 
0,why do we need to break up the big banks  it s not like tesla and apple and amazon and all the big companies can bank at the neighborhood credit union if we orderly capital markets and a strong economy we have to have the big banks 
0,ridiculous and obtuse argument but does nt matter because fuck hillary      _    _  
0,so she was an awful sos because she did nt break up big banks 
0,this article is just the consistent  hillary takes money from big banks  argument  only reworded poorly and framed in a way that makes no sense
0,secretary of state has nothing to do with domestic financial institutions people in this thread are so dumb 
0,yes  well maybe not 250k since he wasnt first lady as well  but there would probably be a big interest in getting him as speaker too
0,why would you think bernie would do that  there s a huge difference between what a politician with no real power will say versus what one will actually do once he is in power 
0,you people are the worst get past her speaking circuit money talk about a more interesting nonissue like her terrible yellow coat 
0,gt  it s not just that the politician wants to act to curry the favor of the rich and powerful  more typically they identify with the interests of the rich and powerful so that they do nt even see themselves as compromising a principle  gt  when we actually see money being handed over to politicians from the wealthy  whether in the form of large speaking fees or a highpaying job  it is probably best to think of it as analogous to a valentine present no one loves their spouse or significant other because of a generous valentine gift  rather it is a symbol of ongoing affection

0,not the best analogy being in the cabinet does nt mean you just get to do whatever you want you d probably have to stay in your lane  how about   bernie sanders spent his 30year political career not just talking about income inequality and the necessity of government regulation on big banks  but acting on it does anyone believe goldman sachs would pay him  250000 to recount his experiences  
0,gt  suppose bernie sanders had spent four years in obama s cabinet and tried to break up the big banks does anyone believe goldman sachs would pay him  250000 to recount his experiences  except hillary did nt say that by all accounts given so far  it was more a rahrah speech than it was her telling goldman of her accounts of trying to break up the big banks so this entire statement is based on a false supposition 
0,i find it funny how almost every comment here is making fun of the stupidity of this post and article yet the article has 4000 points  87  liked  and is sitting at the top of reddit 
0,we ran out of everything else and now we re down to making up shit entirely eh 
0,the top comments in this thread are all people who only read the quote and not the entire article smh
0,wtf what a stupid argument clinton was sec state  not the sec treasury or head of any regulatory agency so she would nt be doing anything to threaten banks they likley had her speak bc she s a clinton  been around and former sec state  even if she was a regulator  it would nt surprise me if she would speak at a banking event  and any  breaking up of banks  would be bc congress came up with a law with regs requiring them to divest themselves of certain busiensses  ie reinstating glass  steagall provisions 
0,are you kidding  of course they would  why do you think it s the toughest most vicious prosecutorsregulators get hired by the banks  not only do poachers make the best gamekeepers  but it also takes them out of the equation if gs offered bernie a million to do some work for them it would make it much harder for him to come down on them later 
0,hillary is a status quo presidential candidate  if she gets the nomination and the job things will remain mostly as they are with little attempt to change them  the big banks know this 
0,just another way of saying what bernie said in the last debate   i m paraphrasing   i guess these banks just love to throw away money  right   it s obvious to anyone who will think about it  but plenty of people are invested in not thinking about it 
0,know thine enemy so yes they would he would most likely refuse it regardless if he was retired or not 
0,you mean  650k
0,i thing goldman sachs is double playing you all 250k is absolutely nothing to them but it is enough to appear to support hillary without really helping her this obviously actually hurts her and helps sanders  the one they really want in office because they can us him to suck the blood out of our economy and send us into depression  where sachs will profit massively 
0,exactly this  if i do not explicitly see it  it does nt exist  mantra is ridiculously short sighted i ve said the same thing before  probably on here   the politicians that do literally change their vote for cash  seem to be the ones that get caught the goal of the money is to bring these people into the same social strata as those with the money make them part of the club the more they hang out  the more washed over with those ideals they will be dishonesty is not a simple process 
0,sanders supporters  one problem is that some of us ca nt get on board with the evil wall street stuff it s very difficult legally to say exactly why and how you re going to prosecute bankers for what happened in 2008 it s very difficult to craft regulations to correct exactly the things we want without having either very bad unintended consequences  or loopholes that render them useless i see it as a problem we have as a country  and something we really need to think about and be smart about bernie actually kinda scares me with his us vs them stuff  if you have the time  take a look at  this video   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  qclmwlgcgg0  of a slightly boring economist who s studied the problem extensively to me this is kind of talk and approach we need if we really want to solve the problem sure  it s not a rousing as bernie s power to the people  stuff  but there you go let the republicans have their demagogues  someone needs to be the smart party 
0,i think it would be money well spent they can learn about his mindset and how to take evasive action for next time 
0,if he actually tried to break up the banks  getting a detailed debriefing of what worked  did nt work  and his thoughts on the matter   250k would be a bargain  think about it if you ran a company with billions in profit  and you spent millions on lobbying  paying think tanks  and other expensive tactics to prevent legislation and regulatory action against it spending  250k to find out from the other side what is actually working and not working would worth every penny 
0,does no one here remember anything that happened back when the clintons were still in arkansas  anyone that wants this person to be the leader of the   free world   has either had their head in the sand for the past 40 years  does nt pay attention to the history of this family  does nt care  or is probably under the age of 25 
0,that is so good  it should be in rshowerthoughts people are starting to wake up   
0,absofuckinglutely the correct question is do you think he d take it
0,if i were a wall street wolf  i would pay 250k for them to tell me how they tried to stop me  so i could learn more about how to defend my stake  and also because 250k is chump change 
0,every economist believes this is not going to do anything another big bank will just come up a few years after i think effective legislationlaws is a better action 
0,gt  the wages of other workers would fall since displaced manufacturing workers would be forced to look for jobs in retail and other sectors the increased supply of workers lowers wages in these other sectors as well recent research by some of the country s top labor economists confirms that trade has been a major factor depressing the wages of large numbers of workers  step 1  have your husband  as president  champion legislation that ships manufacturing to china step 2  walmart becomes the country s largest employer of new lowwage workers step 3  get on the board of directors at walmart step 4  profit  step 5  run for president

0,bernies revolution has to do with congress and the senate right  thats the main premise of his ability to get his policies enacted  to have a revolution  although im sure the republicans will say its to start a communist revolutionary takeover by playing ads with the soviet national anthem im actually looking forward to what kinds of bullshit they will try and throw at him

0, the media is cheating me   every politician ever if you believe it  you re an idiot especially in this case the media actually has massive financial incentive to have a close race between sanders and clinton political ads bring tons of money to television stations  radio stations  etc the closer the race  the more money the candidates are going to spend trying to eek out the victory

0,i m a big sanders supporter  but you got ta admit this was just clinton being smooth as fuck he sweettalked a curator and offered to pick up some litter so he could bring a date into an empty museum that is god damned romantic and in no way political 
0,somehow i thought this would be about them working in place of strikers  the usual meaning of  cross the picket line  which i did think was an odd choice for s first date for anyone curious here is the full quote  from hillary  around which the article is based ethical or not  your choice  i m just providing the quote for those who do nt feel like clicking  gt  we both had wanted to see a mark rothko exhibit at the yale art gallery but  because of a labor dispute  some of the university s buildings  including the museum  were closed as bill and i walked by  he decided he could get us in if we offered to pick up the litter that had accumulated in the gallery s courtyard watching him talk our way in was the first time i saw his persuasiveness in action we had the entire museum to ourselves we wandered through the galleries talking about rothko and twentiethcentury art i admit to being surprised at his interest in and knowledge of subjects that seemed  at first  unusual for a viking from arkansas we ended up in the museum s courtyard  where i sat in the large lap of henry moore s sculpture drape seated woman while we talked until dark 
0,scabs 
0,the actual story here is pretty neat and only solidifies my affection for bill
0,jesus fucking christ they were nt going in as scab workers bill lied about cleaning up the place to get in so he could have an evening alone with his lady this is like a scene from a shitty romantic comedy  not some insightful view into the clinton s neocon leanings for fucks sake can we concentrate on actual fucking issues and not try to convince each other that america s most prominent family of civil servants is evil because their names are nt bernie and sanders 
0,this is a cool story they did nothing wrong it was a creative way to see some interesting art and  in bill s case  a way to impress the girl you like 
0,so bill clinton  as a college kid  conned his way into a museum and had it all to themselves  but this is now a story about how bill and hillary were scabs  and therefore can now be construed to be secretly antilabor  this fucking sub has lost all sense of perspective

0,i was told to vote for this woman by my union  iam  but i voted for obama and i will vote for bernie this post leaves a really bad taste in my mouth what hypocrite s they are 
0,good for them  it s pretty amazing that people are upset that the clintons picked up litter that the people who were being paid to do so refused to do  it s like many people always say if they feel the compensation for the job is nt fair  quit and find a job that s more in line with what they feel they should be getting  if they ca nt find a job that pays what they think they are worth  perhaps they are overestimating the value of the skills they bring to the table  i m aware this article was submitted as an attack piece  but the story makes bill clinton look awesome

0,to me  hillary appears to be a government employee looking for the promotion she feels she earned  contrarily  bernie appears to me to be a civil servant seeking to serve a larger electorate  such perspectives will naturally guide campaigns 
0,most recently  hillary seems to be making her platform   i m just like bernie  but i can actually succeed   which feels increasingly desperate 
0,gt  the new york times reported that clinton  s flailing campaign is trying out a new line  that   sanders is a  onenote  candidate who is captive to an  obsession  with wall street and campaign spending   clinton is determined to prove that sanders is not ready for office  but that she is    if we broke up the big banks tomorrow   clinton asked a group of union members   would that end racism  would that end sexism  would that end discrimination against the lgbt community     so is hillary s main campaign platform  ending racism and sexism  i thought a campaign on ending corruption in government due to big money and handing back power to the american people would be a better idea  gt  just so we  re clear  sanders is an unserious pieinthesky candidate because he wants to rein in campaign spending and institute a health care system that is commonplace in europe clinton  on the other hand  will eradicate sexism and racism in america who  s the dreamer here  after all  clinton can  t even keep her own campaign surrogates  gloria steinem and madeleine albright  from taking sexist swipes at young female bernie supporters  yup  there s this weird argument that bernie s ideas are fantasy and can not happen   even though plenty of other countries have already done it   http  iimgurcomtwl5nkppng   they ll use lines like  usa is bigger and more diverse or congressional obstructionism will prevent any of bernie s policies from happening  as if hillary would fare better with that reasoning   gt  clinton  s attack is  not surprisingly  dishonest  i think most here will agree with this last statement 
0,hillary essentially wants to maintain the status quo  which is nt exactly a great campaign slogan when so many people are alienated by the current political system 
0,can we please have more substantive discussions on why bernie sanders  ideas are the best ideas  i tend to agree with him  but at this point we have pretty much saturated reddit with these posts link to econometric articles  or tax policy articles  etc 
0,how is this title allowed 
0,in a way  this is how government is supposed to work  she s going to change her stance to represent the will of the people in order to win the election  because the election system essentially demands that  what i m concerned with is which ideals politicians will pander to  when politicians say that they think pp will make partial birth abortions mandated for all people  i want to hate that politician and their voters  when politicians say that they think gay marriage should be legal  but they did nt think that before  of course i m going to be suspect of their opinion but i am glad that they changed their mind to that stance  and i m glad the voters put that pressure on

0,i m probably going to be shouted down for this  but i have to say  it s not congress s job to enable the president s agenda it is rather the president s job to faithfully execute the laws congress passes  if it decides to pass any so  yes  they ve obstructed his goals in office  but that s their prerogative likewise  while you and i may dislike it  if congress decides to attempt to hamper his goals in whatever ways its powers allow it to  that s part of the checks and balances present in the constitution  there s no clause in there saying   but if congress  really  wo nt play ball and you  really  want to do something  ignore them and do it anyway  that being said  he is free to tell them they are assholes if he wishes  honestly  i m happy to see a relatively inactive congress the us code is long enough

0,how is that a date   
0,the hillary campaign is about hillary becoming president like she deserves it or something like us electing her is just completing some prophecy that hillary has waited her whole life to fulfill she reminds me of frank underwood in house of cards  the sanders campaign is not about giving sanders something  its about sanders giving the country something he doesnt act like we owe him something  he acts like we owe ourselves something

0,so this is just jeb s final hail mary move  right 
0,the other night trump was met which a chorus of boos for daring to challenge the conservative spin that  george w kept our country safe  trump pointed out that 911 occurred during the bush regime  despite warnings from the cia that this attack was imminent in a report titled   osama bin laden destined to strike in the united states  or something like that  trump also pointed out that bush s destabilizing influence is what created isis and emboldened terrorists in that destabilized region  which is also tantamount to not exactly keeping us safe  the howl of horrified boos from the audience was amazing  as though each of them was drinking the same koolaid
0,the really sad thing is that w looks like winston churchill compared to current crop of gop candidates
0,we need to dispel this notion that jeb bush knows what he s doing jeb bush has no fucking clue what he is doing 
0,jeb needs to get his mommy to help him campaign  and when that does nt work he calls in his brother who is nationally regarded as responsible for many of the problems we face as a country today  please clap 
0,jeb s mother told him to have george speak 
0,remember w was handed a surplus in 2001 and squandered it with incredibly irresponsible tax cuts during time of war the us is the only country in the history of the world to cut taxes during time of war conservatives have no standing to complain about the national debt because largely they caused it  now that we are in the paul ryan era  the budget deficit and national debt any more is absolutely intentional because they will use it to justify cuts in social security and medicare and anything else that does nt benefit the 1   it s the grover norquist method 
0,did you guys watch the speeches  i think it helped him people who do nt want anything to do with the bush family can snicker all they want  but it was definitely a plus for jeb bush has a 70  approval rating with republican voters it ll help with the nomination at least  w warmed up the crowd and jeb had a tough act to follow and it lit a flame jeb has never spoken with so much furor before it s a newer jeb  but probably too late to change much but  if jeb continues with the same confidence as yesterday he could climb to 2nd place rationally  in the very least it bought in the spotlight and people actually can hear about jeb s stance on things 
0,funny how the american media ca nt write stories like these but then  they would have to implicate themselves in absolute failure that was 43 s presidency 
0,i picture jeb  not wanting george to campain for him  but being to bashful to tell him 
0,you know it s bad when you re bringing in dubya to help out on the campaign trail 
0,it s also a reminder that the  burn it all down  mentality has its consequences people did protest votes against gore and the country has  in fact  burn to the ground in many respects a full  third  of our debt   66trillion  is from the bush tax cuts alone  and another 10    17trillion  is from the war in iraq we re looking at thousands dead and maimed servicemen and women and a foreign policy that has directly contributed to the rise of isis and islamic extremism in the middle east civil liberties have been rolled back with the usa patriot act  usa is part of the acronym   and bushappointed alito is practically trying to outcompete thomas for archconservative on the court  which gave us citizens united and nearly derailed the aca

0,what s sad is that the damage the lead poisoning causes is nt really treatable i ve heard that they can kind of remove the lead from a person s body  but the brain damage is irreversible forgot to mention that the damage is done mostly to children  because it stops their brain from developing properly  i first heard about it on npr  it was  this   http  wwwnprorg20160122463929541leadpoisoningdatesbacktoromantimes  interview  this   http  wwwnprorg20151018449747061lessonsfromafighttofixflintswatersupply  one is also pretty good 
0,the comments from the parent about the decline in their child s ability to focus and do their schoolwork was heartbreaking  the fact is that the local and state government decided to turn their heads how much did the federal government know  and how long ago  all these government officials turning their heads and acting like this whole situation is frightening to say the least why did they do it  special interests  lobbyists  was it because the majority of the community was poor and they figured nobody would care  was it racially motivated  all of the above  one has to wonder if this is happening elsewhere in the us these political officials do nt give a rat s ass about communities that do nt contribute to their campaigns  it s time for a change 
0,episode 7 of cosmos  2014  exposes the detrimental effects of lead on humans especially children house are condemn for having lead paint and here we have whole city s water system contaminated by lead and the officials stick their heads in the sand someone needs to be charged with a crime

0,it is  after all  the present year 
0,im a sanders supporter and the 1st thing i thought of was the communities response when hillary did this  my question is with all his talk wtf is bernie going to do right now not when he wins but right now  if he just talks about it honestly hes no better than hillary
0,i like how when sanders does something it s good and totally not for political reasons however  when clinton does something it s a political side show and she is only doing it to get votes 
0,i mean cmon ppl its 2016
0,well sanders  the predominant areas are all in cities controlled by one party and controlled by that same party for decades it is a real shame but it never came to light until they could try and pin it on a republican during an election cycle
0,and they knew  all the way up to the federal epa for months without telling people they were drinking poisoned water they took this time to argue over who s fault it was rather than to come up with a fix  this is nt a failure or one city or one state  it is a failure of government 
0,he s meeting with them now and he did nt know  has nt this been going on for a while 
0,got it hillary goes to flint  to see the people and condemms the situation vote grabbing just trying to get the checkoff for minorities and articles calling her out saying it was for other reasons sanders goes to flint  because he s a great man and condemms the situation  goodness out of his own heart and ttly not related to his political aspirations 
0,think how much  and of importance  will be  how much of flint  michigan s future has already been washed away with poisoned water a generation of young people whose potential has been capped by a lead ceiling they will struggle against for the rest of their lives are we not already engaged in a civil war  of which this is but one of many similar conflicts  this is not peace people at peace do not kill and maim each other with poison 
0,wow  bernie disagrees with poisoning people   just like me      feel the bern
0,the government has horribly failed their citizens what we need now  is bigger government to fix the problem 
0,i do nt like the  think about the children   line how about we re poisoning everyone in the region 
0,i am surprised that none of the billionaires in this country have thought to give back to an american city in need  the american people would love anyone who could do that public universities and private foundations could compete for the prestige of making flint great again 
0,gt  mr sanders said that he didn  t want to be  overly political  but that he had called for the resignation of gov rick snyder of michigan   if the local government can not protect those children  if the state government can not protect those children  then the federal government better   he said  oh really  well you just politicized it dipshit um is nt this a utility and a failure of local government  the federal government would do the exact same thing as the governor and delegate responsibility locally what party was running the city  nevermind i already know the answer  fuck you bernie you re so full of shit 
0,some politicians talk about getting rid of those darn regulations  one said it ll eliminate poverty if we do   i think i d like to see a few more  and maybe some funding for the people running things   unsafe lead levels in tap water not limited to flint   http  wwwnytimescom20160209usregulatorygapsleaveunsafeleadlevelsinwaternationwidehtml

0,i mean  it s 2016 people
0,current year
0,come on guys it s 2016 
0,i might be going out on a limb here but maybe  just maaaaybe i am guessing that not many trump supporters are fond of obama so this will only be fuel for the donald to use in his next rally speech 
0,i think obama knows that there are a significant numbers of republicans that disagree with everything he says  and will thus continue to support trump  from the democrats  perspective  trump is the best gop candidate in the field because he is a wildcard and does nt follow the party line additionally  trump is not afraid to call out the gop s bullshit  even if trump does nt win the nomination  the longer he stays in  the more likely he is to damage the other candidates and the more likely he is to go 3rd party  obama plays chess the gop plays checkers 
0,this comment made by obama will only help trump because it elevated him above all the other opponents in south carolina obama basically recognized him as a front runner by making this statement 
0,what a great endorsement for trump bush and now obama attacking him just cements him as antiestablishment

0,has obama ever even had a private sector job in his life 
0,why do pundits still say trump is nt  serious   trump clearly stands to benefit by winning  both in terms of his net assets and in terms of political power and prestige 
0,yep very serious you literally have to cry on camera to regain your failing support as president  obama just made trump the candidate probably will go up 5  in polls 10  nationally  thank you so much mr obama   yeah  i remember your campaign also mr obama  hope and change  marketing and selling but oh waityou also say that trump is just a great marketershow i dont understand mr obama  are you just a hypocrite  or a bit ignorant  or are you just being a political liar  i thank the sweet baby jesus obama just made trump the candidate because republicans dont like obama and many democrats also dont like obama blacks dont like obama  lol  now you bernie supporters just pray he keeps on kissing the bum of hillary 
0,i see what you did there barack  well played  well played 
0,has trump called him a stupid poopyhead yet

0,they offer the same variation of the time tested outsider vs insider rhetoric that got every president elected since the early 90s  in 2008  it was hillary the beltway insider vs obama the political outsider  in 2000  george bush was the real american  down to earth folk that gets hardworking citizens  in 1992  bill clinton was the american dream he pulled himself from poverty up to the hallowed halls  and earned his way into yale law  now in 2016  we have two candidates who tapped into that same vein and using that rhetoric to get into power it is empty promises and platitudes that amount to nothing when they have to deal with people who disagree with them on a fundamental level

0,as i posted on a different thread  i can not recall  or google  a supreme court candidate being nominated twice hence  if the senate is sincere about rejecting any and all nominees then whoever obama puts forward will be sacrificed it makes for an interesting decision in the white house  nominate the most appropriatedeserving and potentially lose them forever  or nominate a second tier candidate

0,whether im in one of my libertarian moods or proconsumer liberal moods  im proud to always disagree with paul krugman 
0,i think that krugman simply fails to see what s happening  that sleepy america is gradually waking up to the fact that its system of government is badly broken and has to change krugman is a very smart economist  but he s looking at things through the prism of  business as usual  bernie s underlying premise is that  business as usual  has failed government needs to change  and he is leading the call for change it is about  the will of the people 
0,sanders clearly has  happy dreams   why else would he pay his interns less than the  15hour minimum wage he wants to force on the country 
0,to be fair  krugman s a staunch neoliberal so of course he s going to speak out against bernie s economic plans

0,i think bill clinton is an eloquent speaker and profound thinker i wish he would mount a new topic every day 
0,if she did nt know her husband had a loose cannon by now  there s just no excuse 
0,the  mixed race  comment is odd but not completely out of line  notwithstanding the criticism of the random  democratic blogger  they quoted more damaging is probably his claim that hillary clinton is a  changemaker  who can get things done where president obama could not  for two primary reasons  1 anything that she can accomplish with an overwhelmingly republican congress will come at the expense of the voters she is courting in the democratic primary  2 it illustrates an undeserved smugness as well as disdain for president obama s accomplishments it also demonstrates that her attack on senator sanders for being insufficiently supportive of the president is disingenuous political theater 
0,gt  in response  aaron camp  a democratic blogger  wrote   for  mr clinton  to claim that we are all mixed race people    is dismissive of the serious problem of racism and racial inequality in this country  and  as a matter of fact  racist  valid point but i could nt care less what a  blogger  has to say 
0,so i m assuming he s going to nominate someone that the senate has already confirmed for another position  eg  judge sri srinivasan  etc   it s hard for the senate to say someone is nt qualified when they just recently confirmed that same person  unanimously   as they did with srinivasan 970 this also makes me think that it s  not  going to be attorney general loretta lynch  since her confirmation was more of a battle  edit   here is a list   https  enwikipediaorgwikilist_of_federal_judges_appointed_by_barack_obama  of federal judges obama has appointed so far during his presidency as you can see  several of them were unanimously confirmed by the senate 
0,it is a better choice for obama to nominate a moderate  sensible pick  if he goes out on a limb  republicans will find it easy to paint the nominee as a crazy activist leftist if it s someone like sri srinivasan or paul watford  that argument is undercut  and obama can hammer the republicans for obstructing someone so obviously qualified  who they have confirmed before  
0, obama says those who say he should leave the nomination to the next president are reading something into the constitution that just is nt there  edit  accidentally double pasted text 
0,that s not really a story  it s more of a promise it s not like he s gon na say he s gon na nominate an unqualified candidate 
0,qualified  undoubtedly  moderate and fairly benign  thus forcing gop hand   we shall see 
0,what i think will happen  obama nominated srinivasan  he gets shot down in the senate on principle  wish obama would fire back with larry lessig and get him in though

0,after living in south carolina for a year and keeping in touch with people there  i would nt be ecstatic about this if i were a clinton supporter maybe  i d stick with  clinton is favored by 18 points in  a state    i ve got no hate for sc but  let s be honest  even the progressives there average about 30 years behind the curve of liberal culture 
0,only 40  of likely democratic voters have decided who they are voting for though and only 34  of likely black voters have decided i think that bodes well for bernie who has a much better ground game  source  http  wwwcnncom20160216politicssouthcarolinapollcnnorcindexhtml the part i referred to is near the bottom
0,not too terrible considering clinton was expecting to crush sanders into the dirt in sc just a few weeks ago  sc might actually be a nail biter if he keeps gaining 
0,and this is where clinton is supposed to be strongest  she s plummeted the last 2 months in sc
0,the outcome in nevada will weigh heavily on those who have not decided  about a third of black voters  34   say they have decided on a candidate versus nearly 6 in 10 white voters  57      http  wwwcnncom20160216politicssouthcarolinapollcnnorcindexhtml 
0,i need something explained to me from people in the know  why is sander s support so low among blacks  he has been a civil rights activist for as long as we can find records of him has marched with civil rights leaders of the day has been consistent on all of his platforms  what do blacksminorities know that i do not  where should i be looking for stories to explain this  i need some sources on this please i ca nt find sources to adequately explain this to me 
0,hillary s campaign is essentially 3 vs 1  bill and chelsea are continuously sent out to do hillary s dirty work  sanders campaign can rebuff bill  but rebuffing chelsea would undoubtedly result in the clintons labelling him a sexist creeper  luckily they ve been smart enough to avoid that trap

0,her lead is shrinking every day she will be crushed when it comes time for south carolina they re only a few more days and he is slowly slowly coming up on her i think her campaign is in shambles right now and they re really feeling it we re going to see who the true nominee will be clinton is no queen but we are going to see who s going to be crowned king and i will be bernie sanders he is going to be reckoning that this country needs 
0,why pollsters assume a youge black turnout  according to cnn poll  hillary leading among blacks  6528  meanwhile bernie leads among whites  5440   overall result is 5638  so if turnout ratio is 5050 hillary should lead by 65 points  52546   why in the earth black folks will turnout for hillary more than they did for obama back in 2008 primaries
0,clinton is an unethical fraudster fact 
0,not to say this is nt a good result for hillary it is but the trendlines have got to be worrying for her campaign she had a 31 point lead in october and now it s down to 18 points 40  of democratic voters are still trying to decide  so there s room for a potentially big swing  hillary will very likely win sc but the question is by how much i m expecting a low to mid double digit win for her at this point if sanders can hold her to single digits in sc  that will be big 
0,the number of hillary canvassers positively dwarfs the number of sanders canvassers bernie s online support does nt stretch out to the real world
0,so it s a couple of links deep in this article  but if you go into the american gaming association s voter information papers that they actually distributed to gaming workers  they gave trump a yellow  green is considered progaming  red was antigaming  the man currently owns a las vegas hotel and casino and they gave him the same gaming rating as bernie sanders and the only reason they gave sanders a yellow is because  information not available  what an absolute sham the trump name literally is a part of the vegas skyline and this organization is trying to make trump out to be wishywashy on gaming 
0,i love arguing politics with coworkers
0,gt  the group s voter guide would probably pass muster in the precitizens united days  says larry noble  a lawyer for campaign legal center and former general counsel for the federal election commission  so the article is saying that  citizens united  has very little to do with this ability to essentially endorse candidates  before  citizens united   there was nothing wrong with a corporation saying  hillary clinton hates puppies   because the law drew a line at  hillary clinton hates puppies and you should nt vote for her  i m not really sure that makes a huge difference

0,that  casino voter guide   http  bigassetshuffingtonpostcomnvcasinovoterguidepdf  is pure garbage here are some highlights   hillary is designated  opensupportive  of gaming  apparently for paying some recent  lukewarm lip service to casino moguls this is despite her opposition to casinos when she was first lady of arkansas  which is mentioned first in the guide    ben carson is designated  opensupportive   and ted cruz is designated  mixed   but they have the same views  that it s up to individual states whether to allow gambling   cruz apparently loses points for saying the government should nt subsidize casino owners   bernie sanders is designated  mixed   citing  no information available  i suppose they could nt be bothered to make a fiveminute phone call to his campaign before printing up these brochures   donald trump is designated as  mixed   apparently because his atlantic city casinos went bust  along with the rest of ac s local economy   it s mentioned that trump currently operates a hotel on the vegas strip  but no bonus points appear to have been awarded for this 
0,keep just these recent decisions in mind where justice scalia was a part of the 54 majority that could have different outcomes if he is replaced by a democrat president   in a 54 majority limits in mccutcheon v fec  the court invalidated the aggregate contribution limits that were first put in place by the federal election campaign act of 1971   in atamp  t mobility v concepcion  the 54 majority ruled that corporations can effectively mandate arbitration agreements that preclude consumers from bringing class actions to combat fraud and enforce their rights without access to an impartial judge and jury  and without the resources to go it alone in arbitration  people typically abandon their claims and corporate wrongdoers are never held accountable many states enacted consumer protection laws to curtail the pernicious practice of forced arbitration  but in concepcion the supreme court held that such laws are preempted by an old federal statute from 1925 called the federal arbitration act  faa    the 54 majority in michigan v epa overturned epa regulations safeguarding communities from toxic pollution by power plants that causes up to 11000 premature deaths each year essentially  the court  s decision places a premium on businesses  bottom lines over public health and limits the epa  s ability to regulate hazardous air pollutants over the objections of corporate interests   in ledbetter v goodyear tire and rubber co  the 54 court majority made it virtually impossible to bring a claim of longrunning sex or race discrimination in pay under title vii of the 1964 civil rights act  a decision later reversed by a congressional statute a woman had been paid less than her male peers for 20 years and the court stated she had no right to bring a lawsuit for equal pay because she failed to file suit within 180 days of the first discrimination  even though she had no way of learning about the discrimination until years later   in davis v fec  a 54 majority overturned the  millionaire  s amendment   congress  s effort to level the playing field in the political process and reduce the influence of wealth on elections by increasing the contribution limits to candidates facing selffunded opponents   in florence v board of chosen freeholders  the 54 court majority ruled that local officials can stripsearch anyone accused of any crime  even if there is no reason to suspect contraband or concealed weapons  and can not be sued for invasion of privacy   the 54 majority in shelby county v holder overturned a key section of the 1965 voting rights act  making it much harder to protect against discrimination in voting not only did the majority dismissively reject tens of thousands of pages of congressional findings supporting the coverage formula contained in section 4 of the nearlyunanimous 2006 reauthorization of the vra  but the opinion was noted for failing to provide any legal or constitutional rationale for its holding nothing in the text of the constitution was cited to justify the court  s novel decision to strike down the cornerstone of american civil rights law   the 54 majority in leegin creative leather products inc v psks inc overruled a 96yearold rule that had made vertical price fixing per se illegal under federal antitrust law overturning the almost century of antitrust law  the court decided that manufacturers and retailers could sometimes engage in pricefixing in dissent  justice breyer cited studies estimating that this change in law would cost consumers  300 billion a year in increased prices on everyday items   a 53 majority  since justice sotomayor recused herself  in american express co v italian colors restaurant ruled that a smallbusiness owner could not bring an antitrust lawsuit challenging a large corporation  s alleged abuse of its monopoly power  even though  it was claimed  it was that very monopoly power that allowed the corporation to force an agreement to arbitrate and not litigate all complaints against it the court upheld the use of forced arbitration clauses even if it made enforcing federal laws like the sherman act practically impossible in dissent  justice kagan explained that the court  s decision allows   t  he monopolist    to use its monopoly power to insist on a contract effectively depriving its victims of all legal recourse   the 54 majority in burwell v hobby lobby stores  inc decided that forprofit corporations can claim religious rights and can exempt themselves from federal laws requiring them to provide contraceptive coverage to employees the majority also rewrote the religious freedom restoration act  with potentially dangerous consequences for lgbt and other americans   in parents involved in community schools v seattle school district  the 54 court majority prohibited school districts from attempting voluntarily to promote school desegregation through student reassignment plans   in walmart v dukes  approximately one million female walmart employees tried to file a classaction lawsuit over claims of sex bias the 54 decision by the court made it nearly impossible for a class of workers to use for widespread corporate misbehavior that comes in the form of unwritten policies essentially  every worker has to bring their own individual claim  making walmart and other large companies realistically judgment proof to these types of claim   in two 54 decisions  solid waste agency of northern cook county v us army corps of engineers and rapanos v united states  the court effectively took many waterways outside the protection of the clean water act  even though pollution from these waterways can dirty the drinking water of 117 million americans as a result of the court  s decision  1500 major pollution investigations have been halted  and epa actions against water polluters have fallen by 50    in national federation of independent business v sebelius which upheld the patient protection and affordable care act under the taxing power of congress  a 54 majority on the court overturned 70 years of precedent dealing with the commerce clause prior to this case  the court had held that congress has the authority to regulate activities that have a substantial effect on interstate commerce in the area of economic activities   substantial effect  can be found based on the cumulative impact of the activity across the country for example  the supreme court held that congress could use its commerce clause authority to prohibit individuals from cultivating and possessing small amounts of marijuana for personal medicinal use because marijuana is bought and sold in interstate commerce the relationship between health care coverage and the national economy is even stronger and more readily apparent the court had also said that congress could use its commerce power to forbid hotels and restaurants from discriminating based on race  even though their conduct was refusing to engage in commercial activity under an unbroken line of precedents stretching back 70 years  congress has the power to regulate activities that  taken cumulatively  have a substantial effect on interstate commerce people not purchasing health insurance unquestionably has this effect this ruling  if a liberal justice is replaced with someone like scalia  could overturn vast amounts of social programs like medicare and worker protections  on the other hand  occasionally a justice like justice kennedy has sided with the liberal justices to produce 54 decisions that would be in danger if a republican wins the white house and a liberal justice dies or retires while they are in office   in obergefell v hodges  a 54 court majority ruled that the constitution protects the right of samesex couples to marry   a 54 majority in texas department of housing and community affairs v the inclusive communities project upheld the longstanding interpretation of the federal fair housing act to prohibit practices with unjustified discriminatory impact   in massachusetts v epa  a 54 court majority upheld the authority of the epa to regulate greenhouse gases   a 54 majority upheld voterpassed nonpartisan redistricting reform in arizona state legislature v arizona independent redistricting commission   in williamsyulee v the florida bar  a 54 majority upheld a ban on state judicial candidates directly soliciting campaign funds   in boumediene v bush  a 54 majority ruled that prisoners detained in guantanamo can file habeas corpus petitions to challenge their detention   a 54 majority in alabama democratic conference v alabama invalidated a state redistricting scheme that used race to harm minority voters   a 54 majority ruled in favor of workers  rights in csx transportation v mcbride ruling railroads are liable for workers  injuries under federal statute if the railroad was partially responsible for the injury through its negligence

0,currently in nc the only health insurance provider  blue cross and blue shield  for about 1015 eastern counties is going to cease to do business there  so people with preexisting conditions who were finally able to get insurance due to the aca are now being told they will have no coverage within their own county so their only recourse is to travel hours away from their own towns and buy insurance  then whenever they get sick to drive those same hours to see a doctor at all the aca was great for a lot of reasons but it is still very lacking and we need to move forward on true universal health care  not universal health insurance 
0,well we could take down the healthcare monopolies and then allow for capitalism to way down the cost allowing for healthcare providers to compete statewide would help these two would see a cost reduction and open up insurance to people who may not be able to afford it now i does nt have to be universal health care to work  it just ca nt have the monopolies they have now 
0,it only serves to help feeding the doctors who get artificial monopoly with government controlled supply if you want more coverage  allow more medical schools and students instead of subsidizing their monopoly i guess aipac has it under total control with this liberal narrative though
0,if medicaid expansion had been mandatory as in the original law  i think obamacare would be doing a much better job  however complying with the regulations made the private insurance market pretty brutal as far as sticker shock goes the new normal is a highdeductible plan  which incurs a lot more out of pocket lump payouts trying to meet that deductible if you  have health insurance  with a  3000 deductible  you can still easily go bankrupt when that bill hits  if not immediately then somewhere along the journey to your  10000 out of pocket maximum for the year  i have a middleclass job but the only way i could pay for the outofpocket expenses to treat my wife s cancer was borrowing from my 401k  most people are nt so lucky  situations like this are just so unfuckingnecessary that it s incredibly frustrating if america ca nt figure out affordable universal healthcare like every other wealthy country  then america is nt that freaking great 
0,yeah my deductible for going to the er is insanely high so high i could nt pay it anyway so no insurance is the real life reality
0,i had high hopes for the aca  but it has not done anything for me all the plans are either too expensive for me or have very high deductibles i m all for single payer everyone puts in and everyone gets covered seems simple to me 
0,gt  our current medicare which covers the elderly is more efficient a much lower percentage goes for administrative costs leaving more money to spend directly on health care  this lie has been  debunked   http  wwwforbescomsitestheapothecary20110630themythofmedicareslowadministrativecosts  75e149515338   repeatedly   http  wwwahipcoveragecom20140103mythvsfactadministrativecostsinmedicareprivatehealthplans  
0,it s almost like you ca nt get universal and meaningful coverage within a health system defined by forprofit insurance companies 
0,what about the criticism that his healthcare plan has a   3 trillion hole   http  fiscalfactcheckcrfborganalysisofthesanderssinglepayeroffsets  according to the center for a responsible federal budget 
0,how can one vote for a man who did nt receive his first paycheck until he was 40 years old 
0,should nt that be the whole point of insurance  home insurance does nt pay your cable bill car insurance does nt fill up your gas tank 
0,in the 1960s just before the government got involved in health care the cost of full coverage health insurance would be 20 dollars a month after inflation today 
0,dumps pitch on them  more like berning pitch 
0,i for one welcome the rise of the green tea party 
0,gt  yeah  i am telling people what they want to hear  people want jobs they want health care they want educational opportunities for their kids they want to deal with climate change they want the wealthiest people to pay their fair share of taxes yeah  that  s what i  m telling people and on every one of those issues  that is exactly what the american people want 
0,to be honest  if the bernie movement can bring as much change to the democratic party as the tea party brought to the gop  i will be happy hate their agenda  but they did drag the gop to the right and got their candidates elected 
0,i just love the fact that bernie is genuinely as frustrated as most people in america 
0,bill  you deregulated wall street and helped directly cause the great recession stfu and stop ruining your legacy 
0,oh boy  bill has lost his mind 
0,smart move by the bernster just respond as if bill clinton is a harmless rambling little man which is what he s becoming  at this point 
0,the tea party was bought openly this movement is nt bought openly  the money is against us openly  this is nt some fairy tale this is a referendum 
0,sometimes  a lot of times actually  i really genuinely think that bernie sanders is a truly honest man  a gifted man  one in a generation that s not to be taken lightly  i really do believe that in my heart of hearts listen to him absolutely shred bill clinton in no uncertain terms i like this man 
0,bill flubbed agin

0,close but no cigar bill

0,gt  clinton leads sanders 50 percent to 40 percent heading into south carolina  whose democratic voting electorate is more racially diverse than either iowa or new hampshire  sanders holds a narrow 3point advantage over clinton  47 percent to 44 percent  among white voters  gt  while sanders has drawn a significant portion of his support from the youngest voting bloc  under the age of 30   just 25 percent of millennial black voters said they are supporting the vermont senator  compared with 64 percent who said they are backing clinton the reverse is true among white millennials  who support sanders 75 percent to 22 percent  gt  the poll was conducted online from feb 814  surveying 11417 registered voters nationwide the survey s overall margin of error is plus or minus 11 percentage points  this  graph   http  media2snbcnewscomjnewscms2016_071418976nbcsurveymonkey_weekly_election_tracking_poll_clinton_sanders_chartbuilder_adabea7e779bf0fd083d1d5d52364cffnbcnewsux28801000png  that i found  here   http  wwwnbcnewscompolitics2016electionclintonmaintainsnationalleadoversandersafternhlossn519076  shows the national poll  s and sanders slowly  but steadily climbing it also shows hillary s decline on a somewhat sharper slant  due to her own campaign implosions 
0,this is the 2nd national poll since nh that real clear politics refuses to put up 
0,ah yes  the daily  sanders is closing the gap  post 
0,i m glad he s closing the gap  but i would of thought the gap should be smaller given all the scandals surrounding clinton 
0,this is confirmed by  this graph   http  pollingreuterscom  polltr131  of a very informative running poll he s closing the gap among  blacks   http  pollingreuterscom  polltr131filterssc_race  2  very quickly too  a 2540  change over one month  one troubling conclusion from this particular data set for the sanders campaign is that he is gaining almost all of his support from previous nonvoters rather than from converted hillary supporters  particularly in the general population   the early registration deadlines in many states will prevent a large chunk of sanders  momentum from translating to actual votes  since his new supporters will be unable to register up to a month before the primary  for example  in texas  previously unregistered voters activated by his results in iowa  new hampshire and the considerable media attention he s received since then will not be able to vote for him the cumulative effect of this over all states might decide the entire primary election 
0,interesting piece of data from this poll  gt  while sanders has drawn a significant portion of his support from the youngest voting bloc  under the age of 30   just 25 percent of millennial black voters said they are supporting the vermont senator  compared with 64 percent who said they are backing clinton the reverse is true among white millennials  who support sanders 75 percent to 22 percent  this does nt really conform with the media narrative i wonder if there are other polls with similar results 
0,i m sure this has been posted before but has anyone seen this  a bunch of really conservative people have posted this on facebook today and i m worried it is going to hurt bernie in the polls if anyone reads this is there any truth to it  also i m voting for bernie regardless but i just wanted to hear what others had to say  http  wwwthegatewaypunditcom201602berniesandersabumwhodidntearnhisfirstpaycheckuntilage40  mtcid  cf
0,and today s poll has clinton up 21 points in sc national polls do nt really mean much right now it s great he s more widely known nationally but he s done if he does nt perform well in the south

0,national polls do nt matter if he ca nt close the gap with minorities  unfortunately 
0,unfortunately  he s about to get crushed in south carolina  http  projectsfivethirtyeightcomelection2016primaryforecastsouthcarolinademocratic
0,bernie sanders and the whitehouse  if you think the two do nt go together  you re not alone but you re also wrong  not that he would hold that against you because sanders  with apologies to the democrats  barack obama  is perhaps the nicest and most sincere man in politics and has been for 40 years  walk through congress with sanders before the gates open and you ll see him greet the security guards and ushers by name sit near the podium during fillibusters and you ll hear him call out to the lobbyists watch him afterward and you ll find him standing patiently by his locker  respectfully answering the lamest questions from reporters representing the smallest hometown newspapers  that was nt something you would see with hillary clinton  clinton would question your parentage  sanders will ask about your kids  then listen intently to the answer  when the supreme court held a memorial service for justice scalia  sanders flew to texas to see his family  then flew right back to take part in the service never mind that it was his only day off in a month  it s just respect   sanders said  yet a politician who shows respect to everyone does nt always see it in return  clearly sanders lacks the glitz and glamour  the flamboyance and the egotism to stand out in a tabloid world which is why he s thought of primarily as a nice guy and not a great politician  truth is  he s both  he s also crew cuts and blue collars he s middle america  right down to the  please  and  thank you  in his world  guns are for hunting  not for carrying into night clubs  no wonder the license plate on his pickup truck  what else would he drive   once read dbth  shorthand for do nt believe the hype  but you can believe the numbers  which make a strong case that sanders should be the president  in this case  a nice guy should finish first 
0,how many articles do we have to post about him closing the gap  how about posting an article when he closes it 
0,no he s not he s not even close conservative news outlets said the same thing about romney in 2012 just to give false hope even going as far as saying he won the election stop posting sensationalized headlines from misleading sources  edit  the people down voting me because i m stating facts are just as bad as the audience at the last republican debate who booed the moderators for stating facts 
0,gt  trump holds the support of one in three evangelical voters  33 percent  oh  i get it now  those are the hard core evangelicals who want to hasten judgement day trump is their protest vote against this earthly planet
0,i think you really ought to have highlighted this paragraph  gt  while sanders has drawn a significant portion of his support from the youngest voting bloc  under the age of 30     just 25 percent of millennial black voters   said they are supporting the vermont senator  compared with 64 percent who said they are backing clinton   the reverse is true among white millennials  who support sanders 75 percent to 22 percent   sanders supporters are young  white liberals all this talk of  closing the gap  is going to be embarrassing in just a few weeks very similar to the way evangelicals thought the rapture was coming 
0,black voters know that sanders  goals  as good as they might sound  are politically unrealistic hillary is the better choice because at least she will raise the minimum wage to  12  which is more than most people make 
0,the real question with sanders s plan is whether he s just pandering to his base to fire them up and get them more implicated in his campaign or whether he truly believes in this fantasy that he s trying to sell currently a working universal healthcare system needs much stronger price control mechanisms than the ones outlined so far in his plan  it just so happens that those price control mechanisms are also things that would be wildly unpopular to american voters  even though they d result in a fairer  more efficient overall system in the end is he just leading people on for their own good  this type of cynicism would run contrary to the image of integrity and honesty that he s trying to project so i m not completely sure what to make of this theory

0,president obama was very civilized about it  gt   i continue to believe mr trump will not be president and the reason is because i have a lot of faith in the american people and i think that they recognize that being president is a serious job   obama said

0,jesus what is this thread  is there a lot more trump supporters here than i thought 
0,for the people here saying  this will help trump   that s what obama is aiming to do  whoever the democratic nominee is  obama  wants  himher to go up against trump in the general trump is the candidate most likely to selfimplode  even against a meek democratic candidate  let s dispel with this fiction that president obama does nt know what he s doing 
0,obama  you re fired 
0, let me insult a couple prominent members of the senate and then complain about it when they do nt follow me along when i refuse to compromise 
0,honestly  today i had a panic attack when it hit me  we ve all been treating trump like an impossible side show candidate but dear god  he could actually do it the american people really are stupid enough that he could win and not only that the man is dangerous dangerous to world peace  dangerous to minorities  dangerous to human rights  i ca nt keep laughing about this 
0,i think you misspelled  looking  you spelled it  barking 
0,i believe this will just help trump  it seems like he is the main target of obama 
0,yeahbut only because he thinks they should nt automatically reject a scalia clone  should obama nominate one

0,gt  bernie is a problem hillary can  t figure out how to solve  perhaps because he  s not the problem she is   damn  usa today tell us how you really feel   edit   kristen powers  the author of the article  was a member of the clinton organization near the beginning of her career she has since been firm in her support of universal health care and immigration reform  including a path to citizenship however  her stance on social policies are less obvious it s unclear who she supports it s only clear that she has a strong dislike for the clintons 
0,to me  hillary appears to be a government employee looking for the promotion she feels she earned  contrarily  bernie appears to me to be a civil servant seeking to serve a larger electorate  such perspectives will naturally guide campaigns 
0,most recently  hillary seems to be making her platform   i m just like bernie  but i can actually succeed   which feels increasingly desperate 
0,gt  the new york times reported that clinton  s flailing campaign is trying out a new line  that   sanders is a  onenote  candidate who is captive to an  obsession  with wall street and campaign spending   clinton is determined to prove that sanders is not ready for office  but that she is    if we broke up the big banks tomorrow   clinton asked a group of union members   would that end racism  would that end sexism  would that end discrimination against the lgbt community     so is hillary s main campaign platform  ending racism and sexism  i thought a campaign on ending corruption in government due to big money and handing back power to the american people would be a better idea  gt  just so we  re clear  sanders is an unserious pieinthesky candidate because he wants to rein in campaign spending and institute a health care system that is commonplace in europe clinton  on the other hand  will eradicate sexism and racism in america who  s the dreamer here  after all  clinton can  t even keep her own campaign surrogates  gloria steinem and madeleine albright  from taking sexist swipes at young female bernie supporters  yup  there s this weird argument that bernie s ideas are fantasy and can not happen   even though plenty of other countries have already done it   http  iimgurcomtwl5nkppng   they ll use lines like  usa is bigger and more diverse or congressional obstructionism will prevent any of bernie s policies from happening  as if hillary would fare better with that reasoning   gt  clinton  s attack is  not surprisingly  dishonest  i think most here will agree with this last statement 
0,hillary essentially wants to maintain the status quo  which is nt exactly a great campaign slogan when so many people are alienated by the current political system 
0,can we please have more substantive discussions on why bernie sanders  ideas are the best ideas  i tend to agree with him  but at this point we have pretty much saturated reddit with these posts link to econometric articles  or tax policy articles  etc 
0,how is this title allowed 
0,in a way  this is how government is supposed to work  she s going to change her stance to represent the will of the people in order to win the election  because the election system essentially demands that  what i m concerned with is which ideals politicians will pander to  when politicians say that they think pp will make partial birth abortions mandated for all people  i want to hate that politician and their voters  when politicians say that they think gay marriage should be legal  but they did nt think that before  of course i m going to be suspect of their opinion but i am glad that they changed their mind to that stance  and i m glad the voters put that pressure on 
0,till date no hillary supporter has been able to tell me what her agenda is and why she wants to be president

0,in light of scalia s passing  hillary has been doubling down on her claim that she is the more  electable  of the two yet  when those who value trustworthiness flock to bernie s side  by 91  to 5   even that claim is dubious 
0,this is literally an opinion article and does nt belong here 
0, i m not a one issue candidate because we are not a one issue country  misses the mark money in politics is the issue how can you have an honest conversation about any other issue when special interest groups hold sway over the political system and people s interests  she s nibbling at the edges and bernie is going straight for the heart

0,i wish people had reasonable discussions on reddit instead of just making hillary out to be this evil selfcentered fiend when you state that her only motivation for being president is because it s her turn it makes me think you re either being intentionally manipulative or you re just plain stupid

0,the big difference here is that one group is using odd year cycles in which voter participation is low to gain an advantage while the other group is limiting voter participation in all elections  in the first case  there s nothing that prevents the electorate from participating in full other than their own apathy in the second  there is a barrier to full participation  there s a distinct difference between using the rules to your advantage and changing the rules to your advantage  edit  the only  legitimate  problem that is solved by voter id laws is voter impersonation one person casting a vote as another  while ostensibly also casting their own vote  there have been fewer than 31 incidents of this type for over 1 billion votes cast   https  wwwwashingtonpostcomnewswonkwp20140806acomprehensiveinvestigationofvoterimpersonationfinds31credibleincidentsoutofonebillionballotscast  so this is a problem that has a 0000000031  impact on our elections but denies the vote to hundreds of thousands of americans

0,and i think 99  of bernie sanders  supporters would be just as happy  if not happier  with warren 
0,i believe they probably have discussed this between the two of them and decided that bernie would run for whatever reasons 
0,was nt sanders recruited to run by the people who started the draft warren group after she firmly declined to run 
0, if thing that did not happen had happened  then other thing that did happen might not have happened  great reporting 
0,there were a ton of people who should have run  but did nt bother because the process seemed set up for hillary to win who saw kerryedwards coming in 2004  historically way more people on both sides have been willing to give it a shot and see how it goes  turning the nominating process into hillary s coronation was a huge mistake 
0,what are you doing  bill  
0,i compare clinton supporters to republicans like jeb 
0,the ironic thing is that the democratic party could benefit from having a radical  do this or be primaried  movement willing to push the party to the left and allow the moderates to say  i would pact with you but those crazy people would eat my liver   in parlamentary systems the comunistgreenleftlibertarian parties are the ones doing pushing so the democratic socialist and liberal parties remain honest  it is heartbreaking that the husband of a  progressive  sees the progresive wing of his own party as the enemy  since hillary and bernie  agree  on so many things it must be so hard for her 
0,i m not sure she would have a chance against clinton though the reason bernie has been so effective is because of his recordrhetoric she does nt have the record 
0,warren is most effective in the senate 
0,good at least _someone_ seems to see what s happening  shape up or be fractured  dnc 
0,please give bernie some credit for daring this  radical  campaign   i do nt think it was an battle to lose to begin with and it is nt now i admire his courage more 
0,i ve been a bernie fan since he arrived in congress in 1991 but i would have been perfectly happy with warren as a candidate she s better known and bernie did not want to run i listened to the onceaweek brunch with bernie hour on the thom hartmann radio show and bernie kept hoping a progressive like warren would run when no one came forward  he began talking about running himself

0,trump is savage buys the jeb bush website out from under him i hope he keeps the domain and isnt forced to give it back 
0,as someone who used to be responsible for a companies website  keeping domains and secure certificates current  you have to be really fucking stupid to let them expire not just because of what happened but you start getting reminders well before it expires  so to let it expire you purposely have to ignore it  or be so incompetent to assign your notifications to a nonmonitored email address you also have the option for automatic renewal if you ca nt be bothered to read your email plus you would think they would have paid for enough time to actually cover the campaign season 
0,i was taught at a young age  under 10  about not crossing a picket line  but i lived in las vegas with some decent unions would the clinton s have been taught that lesson before they were  20 raised elsewhere in the 60 s

0,it is a better choice for obama to nominate a moderate  sensible pick  if he goes out on a limb  republicans will find it easy to paint the nominee as a crazy activist leftist if it s someone like sri srinivasan or paul watford  that argument is undercut  and obama can hammer the republicans for obstructing someone so obviously qualified  who they have confirmed before

0,gt  because he is facing the clinton machine  as well as the conservatism of mainstream media    sanders might not win the race but it has now been demonstrated that another sanders  possibly younger and less white  could one day soon win the us presidential elections and change the face of the country   in many respects  we are witnessing the end of the politicoideological cycle opened by the victory of ronald reagan at the 1980 elections   not me us   bernie sanders as he has said time and time again  it s not about bernie  it s about the grassroots movement of the american people that must rise up and take back government from big corporations and financial institutions if bernie does not succeed and win the presidency  then someone else will take his place the seeds real change have been sown  gt  sanders  success today shows that much of america is tired of rising inequality and these socalled political changes  and intends to revive both a progressive agenda and the american tradition of egalitarianism hillary clinton  who fought to the left of barack obama in 2008 on topics such as health insurance  appears today as if she is defending the status quo  just another heiress of the reaganclintonobama political regime  could nt agree more on this assessment 
0,wish the article was more in depth this was interesting  though  if sure to raise hackles   gt  sanders  success today shows that much of america is tired of rising inequality and these socalled political changes  and intends to revive both a progressive agenda and the american tradition of egalitarianism hillary clinton  who fought to the left of barack obama in 2008 on topics such as health insurance  appears today as if she is defending the status quo  just another heiress of the reaganclintonobama political regime  if you have nt read picketty s  capital in the 21st century  it s definitely worth it 
0,if you spend 4 decades attacking american wages and benefits by any means necessary  you are going to strengthen social democrats  socialists and even outright communists its a natural reaction to bad conduct 
0,gt  hillary clinton  who fought to the left of barack obama in 2008 on topics such as health insurance  appears today as if she is defending the status quo  i felt obama was going to be more liberal than hillary  was i wrong to think that in 2008 
0,ok guys  i love bernie but this is a random unscientific online poll that is about as meaningful as a poll of reddit users 
0,i do nt know why clinton and her campaign believes that the south is going to be a safe haven for her  you see  the thing about southern democrats is that they share alot of thoughts and feelings with southern republicans that live all around them  every day  for their entire lives  if you keep on hearing and seeing people talk about how much they hate hillary clinton as southern democrats do when they re around southern republicans  some of that will eventually seep in

0,eventually  absolutely but it s going to be a rocky road in the mean time as big  throws everything they have at him to discredit and make him look weak fixing the corruption in this country is nt going to be fast or easy and will take everyone biting the bullet for a while we need to pursue what is right instead of the almighty buck

0,i would be shocked if bernie wins sc
0,i think sanders will win nevada  but the polling in south carolina sets up a seemingly insurmountable gap no way he wins in sc 
0,ah yes  the reputable  lifezette 
0,if bernie wins sc  its over for hillary
0,nevada that would be closer to an upset  but even then they ve polled closely for a while now  even going back prior to iowa and nh sanders only polled behind by what  9 points or something  i firmly believe sanders will win nevada  now  if sanders wins sc  that would be an upset 
0,kinda like she was out voted in nh 
0,a good ground game can only go so far  ie ron paul in 2012 
0,so i m assuming he s going to nominate someone that the senate has already confirmed for another position  eg  judge sri srinivasan  etc   it s hard for the senate to say someone is nt qualified when they just recently confirmed that same person  unanimously   as they did with srinivasan 970 this also makes me think that it s  not  going to be attorney general loretta lynch  since her confirmation was more of a battle  edit   here is a list   https  enwikipediaorgwikilist_of_federal_judges_appointed_by_barack_obama  of federal judges obama has appointed so far during his presidency as you can see  several of them were unanimously confirmed by the senate 
0,it is a better choice for obama to nominate a moderate  sensible pick  if he goes out on a limb  republicans will find it easy to paint the nominee as a crazy activist leftist if it s someone like sri srinivasan or paul watford  that argument is undercut  and obama can hammer the republicans for obstructing someone so obviously qualified  who they have confirmed before  
0, obama says those who say he should leave the nomination to the next president are reading something into the constitution that just is nt there  edit  accidentally double pasted text 
0,that s not really a story  it s more of a promise it s not like he s gon na say he s gon na nominate an unqualified candidate 
0,qualified  undoubtedly  moderate and fairly benign  thus forcing gop hand   we shall see 
0,what i think will happen  obama nominated srinivasan  he gets shot down in the senate on principle  wish obama would fire back with larry lessig and get him in though 
0,warren  biden 
0,talk about balls  trump has absolutely no idea what these dudes are gon na say and he gives them the mic great stuff 
0,somebody does nt want to campaign on not doing his job 
0, he advised the president to nominate someone who has  an almost identical resume and capabilities of justice scalia   funny  did nt hear shit like this when they installed uber conservative clarence thomas to replace uber liberal thurgood marshall 
0,i think it is pretty hilarious that this is being referred to as a  conservative seat  on the scotus that s not actually how that works 
0,yeahbut only because he thinks they should nt automatically reject a scalia clone  should obama nominate one 
0,he wo nt be the last to break ranks too many of them are vulnerable in the election to hold the supreme court hostage while they re trying to campaign it would be a talking point at every rally or debate they went to  and it s a damned near impossible position to defend as anything other than   i do nt like obama  so i m preventing the highest court in the land from operating properly 
0, if he puts forth someone that we think is in the mold of president obama  s vision for america  then we  ll use every device available to block that nomination   tillis said he advised the president to nominate someone who has  an almost identical resume and capabilities of justice scalia   wtf  that is just plain stupid  dude  your team lost the election

0,must not be up for reelection 
0,welp  we ve finally done it  reached the point where a republican politician behaving  normally  is so outside the norm  it s breaking news 
0,gop calling their own tactics obstructionist  what s the temperature in hell right now 
0,the gop is putting their heads on blocks here ideally they get obama to nominate someone moderate then slow play until after the election if the dem wins they ratify obama s nom in a lame duck session if the republican wins they table the whole thing and their guy gets a pick  by outright refusing they open the door to obama not nominating anyone  or nominating a dream liberal who they ca nt support either way they look like the aholes who refused point blank before they knew what the offer was obviously this will be decided by the election  which is a startlingly democratic idea   i know obama should get this pick  but he really does nt have any leverage here  it s a political reality  what they should have done is suggest a dream nominee of their own an idea obama  or any president  could nt support then it s a dirty political fight on both sides and congress can play some offense during election season their is no rule that says they ca nt suggest a nominee 
0,yes  obstruct the nominee let the nominee be another symbol of what republicans have brought to the table over the last 7 years the republican party is a national disgrace 
0,how dare he use such an accurate and exact term 
0,gt  gop lawmaker willing to give us empty lip service 
0,is being obstructionist illegal 
0,how many more do we need  like 4 
0,evidently tillis does nt really understand that it still obstructionism saying you re going to use every device available to block a nomination unless obama picks someone in the mold of scalia or it s just typical gop doublespeak saying his party wo nt be obstructiveas long as they get what they want  assholes man 
0,overblown he s simply giving the logical answer  yeah  we ll listen to him we ll still veto him  but we ll listen first 
0,wow  i was nt expecting the senator to be tillis maybe he s cognizant that he ll probably have a strongly contested election in 2020  because i had him pegged as a bit extreme 
0,they voted for revolutionary change  they got a vetocracy

0,really  either he s retiring or he s not up for reelection for a while 
0,it will be very interesting how this whole thing shakes out i saw an article about rand paul saying that obama has a conflict of interest in appointing a sc nominee since many of the cases the scotus will be reviewing are dealing with which powers the president does and does not have obama will pick someone who has similar views to himself  but it will be interesting to see what their thoughts on presidential powers is 
0,and what is this persons name so that we can honor him 
0,sounds more like message refinement than a break from the party 
0,somebody is about to get primaried
0,too many of them are vulnerable in the saturday night massacre

0,where is chuck schumer when you need him ca nt we just filibuster for  oh say  18 months 
0,the  r  s just need to find a guy who uses terms like  jiggery pokery  and  pure applesauce  in legal opinions on a regular basis 
0,it is funny watching a dying party desperately exercise what power they have even if it makes them look like fools and only hurts their cause  btw my comments are related to how childish and foolish the party has acted in the last 5 years or so not saying they are going anywhere long term but it is just crazyness 
0,its also just unwise if they block his pick long enough  he ll just make a recess appointment while they re on one of their many vacations boom  senate oversight bypassed its ugly  but they re playing ugly 
0,is this buzzfeed  wtf is this click bait shit 
0,i feel that a progressive party would be inclusive to conservatives who understand social living and liberals who can fathom rural living the gop and democratic party have spent too much time forcing a false choice  imho 
0, we would strongly prefer you nominate the ghost of antonin scalia 
0, we should consider who obama nominates  but if they are nt exactly who we want based of our political ideology  we will block it  sore fucking losers they need to come back to the real world and realize that moderation and compromise run a government 
0, reads title  wow a pragmatic sane republican  reads article   if he puts forth someone that we think is in the mold of president obama  s vision for america  then we  ll use every device available to block that nomination  annnnnnnnd he s back
0,when i grow up  i want to be a senator so i can fillibuster  obstruct  and delay others from doing their jobs for as long as possible 
0,so this is how it s going to be  endless posts about this  despite nothing actually happening yet

0,well after 7 years he is probably real familiar with barack s aka barry s selection patterns  after loretta lynch and sotomayor it is a no brainier to assume that barry will pick another loser
0,holy shit  what in the fuck is going on here  first of all  this video seems suspicious these guys were way too comfortable with public speaking that s literally the  1 ranked fear  over  death   and these guys were nt shook in the slightest they each had concise  thoughtout statements to make when put on the spot they independently represented different portions of the constituency feels like a planned viral event  and then i come in the comments here and it is jampacked with glowing commendations of trump no one s really talking about the protester  or the two guys just a whole lot of  wow trump is great  he has balls to let them do that    is this how trump plans to sway middle america  are we being marketed to 
0,must be sarcasm itt because no way redditors suddenly like trump 
0,we did nt want obama to approach this job as a cynic  by now he has earned it while most have gotten frustrated watching it  this has been his entire waking life for over 7 years i would like to hear his commentaries of the process once he no longer has to keep decorum  this likely wo nt change  no matter who gets in each and every presidential contender left has pissed off a large number of people within the gop trump  rubio  jeb  and cruz are just as likely to be labeled the antichrist as sanders and hillary

0,everyone hates the senate no matter who is in charge of it need term limits 
0,almost 
0,the republicans want the government to fail so that they can say the government is bad and inefficient  and they can sell off the pieces to private corporations 
0,wait what if seeing that congress refuses to work with our president he just says ok i am going to veto everything congress passes till i get my way 
0,did nt obama also take part in obstructing the approval of a bush scotus nominee 
0,everyone say it with me    elections have consequences 
0,i personally have completely become accustomed to it i expect them to obstruct just about every thing that touches the left half of the spectrum  and so far  they have 
0,what chaps my ass is mr obama did nt say this five years ago  when the pattern was already well established 
0, well  at least they re not filibustering to keep the other party s majority from voting   http  articleschicagotribunecom20060130news0601300193_1_filibusterjudgealitoconfirmation 
0,he should know what he s talking about  since he joined john kerry in 2006 to filibuster george w bush s nomination of samuel alito to the supreme court 
0,yea  you almost have go back 2 whole years when the dems were in charge and harry reid would not even allow gop amendments to be voted on 
0,yeah well welcome to a 2 party system
0,checks and balances something something
0,oh ya  lets just pretend the dems did nt do the exact same thing when bush was in office 
0,hah  says the guy who has  himself  filibustered a scotus appointment 
0,shit  the dems would do the same thing both parties have to go 
0,dragging ass is only going to hurt the republicans with moderates and undecideds in the general election 
0,man those checks and balances of power in the constitution are a real downer 
0,this is a consequence of changing how the senators are elected it used to be that the house of representatives  and to some extent it is still called this   called the  people s house  basically  the senators used to be appointed by the states  and that was changed in the early part of last century  which puts a different kind of pressure on the senators to be as partisan as the house has always been 
0,we ve almost become accustomed to how obstructionist both parties can be with us stuck in the middle if only there were third parties and better voting systems to more accurately represent us 
0,we have three branches in order to separate powers this is part of it people act like this is something new the legislative branch  republican  is going to fight to leverage power from the executive branch  democrat  by trying to get more conservatives into the judicial branch a democratcontrolled senate would do the same to a republican president if roles were flipped and rbg s spot became available 
0,i m probably going to be shouted down for this  but i have to say  it s not congress s job to enable the president s agenda it is rather the president s job to faithfully execute the laws congress passes  if it decides to pass any so  yes  they ve obstructed his goals in office  but that s their prerogative likewise  while you and i may dislike it  if congress decides to attempt to hamper his goals in whatever ways its powers allow it to  that s part of the checks and balances present in the constitution  there s no clause in there saying   but if congress  really  wo nt play ball and you  really  want to do something  ignore them and do it anyway  that being said  he is free to tell them they are assholes if he wishes  honestly  i m happy to see a relatively inactive congress the us code is long enough 
0,says the former obstructionist senator

0,no one is saying he does nt have an impressive record  they re saying his plans for the future are unrealistic blustering about how great his record is does nt make his plans any more feasible the right is much closer to a political revolution than the left  we re running interference this time around
0,whether im in one of my libertarian moods or proconsumer liberal moods  im proud to always disagree with paul krugman 
0,i think that krugman simply fails to see what s happening  that sleepy america is gradually waking up to the fact that its system of government is badly broken and has to change krugman is a very smart economist  but he s looking at things through the prism of  business as usual  bernie s underlying premise is that  business as usual  has failed government needs to change  and he is leading the call for change it is about  the will of the people 
0,sanders clearly has  happy dreams   why else would he pay his interns less than the  15hour minimum wage he wants to force on the country 
0,to be fair  krugman s a staunch neoliberal so of course he s going to speak out against bernie s economic plans
0,to be fair  krugman is sort of a dumb guy 
0,all this is doing is encouraging simpleminded trump supporters to attack protestors in the hopes they ll get the opportunity to meet their phony hero i ca nt wait to watch trump get trounced in the general  fueled specifically by votes from the very people he denigrates 
0,hillary s biggest foe in this election is google 
0,the hillary campaign is about hillary becoming president like she deserves it or something like us electing her is just completing some prophecy that hillary has waited her whole life to fulfill she reminds me of frank underwood in house of cards  the sanders campaign is not about giving sanders something  its about sanders giving the country something he doesnt act like we owe him something  he acts like we owe ourselves something 
0,the clinton s are using old scare tactics and smear campaigning from the 90s but with the birth of the internet and quickfact checking  the clintons have destroyed their own campaign more than anyone else has 
0,wow i feel like most people wo nt have time to read the whole thing  but this is really insightful and well written  if you sort through enough trash  salon can really surprise you with some great stuff once in a while 
0,welcome to the information age  where your past words and exploits are but a click away and your facts and arguments that played so well to a captive audience  are disseminated and refuted within 24 hours and before they ve had their chance to sway voters

0,hillary comes across on tv as a complete liar her body language and fake cackling laugh just sets alarm bells off in any reasonable person  coupled with videos of her saying one thing then lying to give the opposite impression  she simply comes across as a richard nixon clone 
0,dae boo hillary 
0,i think it s a little too early to say it s a failed strategy 
0,savage donald  i literally own you  trump  ladies and gentlemen 
0,gt  bernie is a problem hillary can  t figure out how to solve  perhaps because he  s not the problem she is   damn  usa today tell us how you really feel   edit   kristen powers  the author of the article  was a member of the clinton organization near the beginning of her career she has since been firm in her support of universal health care and immigration reform  including a path to citizenship however  her stance on social policies are less obvious it s unclear who she supports it s only clear that she has a strong dislike for the clintons 
0,to me  hillary appears to be a government employee looking for the promotion she feels she earned  contrarily  bernie appears to me to be a civil servant seeking to serve a larger electorate  such perspectives will naturally guide campaigns 
0,most recently  hillary seems to be making her platform   i m just like bernie  but i can actually succeed   which feels increasingly desperate 
0,gt  the new york times reported that clinton  s flailing campaign is trying out a new line  that   sanders is a  onenote  candidate who is captive to an  obsession  with wall street and campaign spending   clinton is determined to prove that sanders is not ready for office  but that she is    if we broke up the big banks tomorrow   clinton asked a group of union members   would that end racism  would that end sexism  would that end discrimination against the lgbt community     so is hillary s main campaign platform  ending racism and sexism  i thought a campaign on ending corruption in government due to big money and handing back power to the american people would be a better idea  gt  just so we  re clear  sanders is an unserious pieinthesky candidate because he wants to rein in campaign spending and institute a health care system that is commonplace in europe clinton  on the other hand  will eradicate sexism and racism in america who  s the dreamer here  after all  clinton can  t even keep her own campaign surrogates  gloria steinem and madeleine albright  from taking sexist swipes at young female bernie supporters  yup  there s this weird argument that bernie s ideas are fantasy and can not happen   even though plenty of other countries have already done it   http  iimgurcomtwl5nkppng   they ll use lines like  usa is bigger and more diverse or congressional obstructionism will prevent any of bernie s policies from happening  as if hillary would fare better with that reasoning   gt  clinton  s attack is  not surprisingly  dishonest  i think most here will agree with this last statement 
0,hillary essentially wants to maintain the status quo  which is nt exactly a great campaign slogan when so many people are alienated by the current political system 
0,can we please have more substantive discussions on why bernie sanders  ideas are the best ideas  i tend to agree with him  but at this point we have pretty much saturated reddit with these posts link to econometric articles  or tax policy articles  etc 
0,how is this title allowed 
0,in a way  this is how government is supposed to work  she s going to change her stance to represent the will of the people in order to win the election  because the election system essentially demands that  what i m concerned with is which ideals politicians will pander to  when politicians say that they think pp will make partial birth abortions mandated for all people  i want to hate that politician and their voters  when politicians say that they think gay marriage should be legal  but they did nt think that before  of course i m going to be suspect of their opinion but i am glad that they changed their mind to that stance  and i m glad the voters put that pressure on 
0,till date no hillary supporter has been able to tell me what her agenda is and why she wants to be president
0,fuck s sake people  i m a bernie fan and have never liked hillary  but this is getting absurd 5600 upvotes for an essay that offers absolutely nothing new of substance  and is just a retread of an established talking point for the past two months 
0,i know rpolitics is probernie  and i have yet to make up my mind however  that title makes me cringe  especially since the article linked is nt titled that way 
0,in light of scalia s passing  hillary has been doubling down on her claim that she is the more  electable  of the two yet  when those who value trustworthiness flock to bernie s side  by 91  to 5   even that claim is dubious 
0,this is literally an opinion article and does nt belong here

0, i m not a one issue candidate because we are not a one issue country  misses the mark money in politics is the issue how can you have an honest conversation about any other issue when special interest groups hold sway over the political system and people s interests  she s nibbling at the edges and bernie is going straight for the heart

0,gt  french economist
0,one problem that will need to be addressed before even mr sanders  economic prescriptions can work  our currency is overloaded  in a computer program  if the programmer tries to do too many things with one variable  the result is sure failure humans overload their currencies in the same way and to the same result  they try to make their currencies do too many things at the same time a medium of exchange  a medium of wealth storage  a means of demonstrating success  etc this can be fixed by using specific currencies for specific things  a saving currency  a trading currency  an investment currency  etc make tax policies specific to the uses of the various currencies and to their conversions from one type to another this would require secure electronic currencies  on a related note  what is a good way to really screw up a government  hoard their currency or otherwise take it out of circulation  the us and other governments are experiencing this now as multinational corporations stash currencies in outofreach banks governments are foolish to allow these people  aka  corporations   to undermine their currencies in this manner

0,did nt some prohillary supporters  along with most media  say weeks ago  and for months on end  that even if bernie managed to win iowa and new hampshire that nevada would be his death knell because it had a large minority population and that bernie would nt be able to attract said minority voters  hmmm  oh now it s 80  white  great keep moving that goal post  gt  her staff repeatedly claimed that nevada was as white as the first two early states this was not only risibly false  but a clear sign that she wasn  t just lowering expectations but showing real fear she could lose nevada  february 20th ca nt come soon enough 
0,as a californian who just spent the weekend in nevada  you can tell her campaign there is getting desperate she has an ad in every tv commercial spot i d say the ratio of clinton to sanders ads were about 8  1 the one where she s  spent her life fighting for the childrens   i ve heard at least fifty times

0,did anyone else cringe a little bit when hillary named mandela as the foreign leader who would influence her foreign policy then hamhandedly segwayed into how she thinks bernie disrespects obama  it seemed like such a pander to the  mostly black  audience in south carolina that cost her the nomination there in 2008  i was happy that bernie forcefully defended himself there and told her he s supported obama throughout his term but  as a us senator  had a duty to the people to question the president in certain issues that s bernie s commitment to democracy over politics  something hillary does nt get 
0,let s dispel with this fiction that the clintons do nt know what they re doing they know exactly what they re doing

0,let s talk about how secretary of state was too much for her and had her contemplating leaving politics multiple times 
0,staaahhhhhp
0,does nt this simply show that people are willing to pay a lot of money to hear hillary s views  and that wall street has a lot of respect for her global perspective  regardless of her policy proposals   i know it s easy to paint her as prowall street for this  but getting paid for a speech is far from lobbying for wall street or being  bought and paid for  anyone familiar with her platform would know that  i would be more skeptical if she spoke for free 
0,somebody does nt want to campaign on not doing his job 
0, he advised the president to nominate someone who has  an almost identical resume and capabilities of justice scalia   funny  did nt hear shit like this when they installed uber conservative clarence thomas to replace uber liberal thurgood marshall 
0,i think it is pretty hilarious that this is being referred to as a  conservative seat  on the scotus that s not actually how that works 
0,yeahbut only because he thinks they should nt automatically reject a scalia clone  should obama nominate one 
0,he wo nt be the last to break ranks too many of them are vulnerable in the election to hold the supreme court hostage while they re trying to campaign it would be a talking point at every rally or debate they went to  and it s a damned near impossible position to defend as anything other than   i do nt like obama  so i m preventing the highest court in the land from operating properly 
0, if he puts forth someone that we think is in the mold of president obama  s vision for america  then we  ll use every device available to block that nomination   tillis said he advised the president to nominate someone who has  an almost identical resume and capabilities of justice scalia   wtf  that is just plain stupid  dude  your team lost the election

0,the gop is putting their heads on blocks here ideally they get obama to nominate someone moderate then slow play until after the election if the dem wins they ratify obama s nom in a lame duck session if the republican wins they table the whole thing and their guy gets a pick  by outright refusing they open the door to obama not nominating anyone  or nominating a dream liberal who they ca nt support either way they look like the aholes who refused point blank before they knew what the offer was obviously this will be decided by the election  which is a startlingly democratic idea   i know obama should get this pick  but he really does nt have any leverage here  it s a political reality  what they should have done is suggest a dream nominee of their own an idea obama  or any president  could nt support then it s a dirty political fight on both sides and congress can play some offense during election season their is no rule that says they ca nt suggest a nominee 
0,yes  obstruct the nominee let the nominee be another symbol of what republicans have brought to the table over the last 7 years the republican party is a national disgrace

0,is being obstructionist illegal 
0,how many more do we need  like 4 
0,evidently tillis does nt really understand that it still obstructionism saying you re going to use every device available to block a nomination unless obama picks someone in the mold of scalia or it s just typical gop doublespeak saying his party wo nt be obstructiveas long as they get what they want  assholes man 
0,overblown he s simply giving the logical answer  yeah  we ll listen to him we ll still veto him  but we ll listen first 
0,wow  i was nt expecting the senator to be tillis maybe he s cognizant that he ll probably have a strongly contested election in 2020  because i had him pegged as a bit extreme

0,really  either he s retiring or he s not up for reelection for a while 
0,it will be very interesting how this whole thing shakes out i saw an article about rand paul saying that obama has a conflict of interest in appointing a sc nominee since many of the cases the scotus will be reviewing are dealing with which powers the president does and does not have obama will pick someone who has similar views to himself  but it will be interesting to see what their thoughts on presidential powers is 
0,and what is this persons name so that we can honor him

0,its also just unwise if they block his pick long enough  he ll just make a recess appointment while they re on one of their many vacations boom  senate oversight bypassed its ugly  but they re playing ugly 
0,is this buzzfeed  wtf is this click bait shit 
0,i feel that a progressive party would be inclusive to conservatives who understand social living and liberals who can fathom rural living the gop and democratic party have spent too much time forcing a false choice  imho 
0, we would strongly prefer you nominate the ghost of antonin scalia 
0, we should consider who obama nominates  but if they are nt exactly who we want based of our political ideology  we will block it  sore fucking losers they need to come back to the real world and realize that moderation and compromise run a government 
0, reads title  wow a pragmatic sane republican  reads article   if he puts forth someone that we think is in the mold of president obama  s vision for america  then we  ll use every device available to block that nomination  annnnnnnnd he s back

0,this is nt the same thing bill and hillary are married i assume probably met doing something politically active  and they grew together and nurtured each other s careers it s not surprising that both of them would dedicate their lives to politics and potentially both reach the top  the bushes  on the other hand  are related by blood  not by common interest in that case it s more like a hereditary ruler  what the op means by  close family member

0,gt  debunked this assertion with data showing that fewer than 1 in 10 abortion providers are in majorityblack neighborhoods the black population is largely concentrated into fairly tight areas  and make up less than 12  of the us population it would be interesting to see what percentage of black people as a whole have an abortion clinic in their zip code  zip was what was used in this  study   vs white people  to be a majority black neighborhood there would have to be quite a few black people there since their usage means that black people made up of 50  or more of the neighborhood  it could be 49  black  48  hispanic and they would nt consider it  majority black

0,does anyone know if conservatives  particularly republicans in the south  have some kind of more subtle agenda  s  beneath the veneer of  prolife  and  limited government   attempts to impede women s access to care in 2016 is so absurd that i often wonder if the motivations are deeper than just ignorancesexismracism  religion  and political ideology the ultimate consequences of interfering with women s health rights are so obviously ass backwards and to the detriment of society it makes my head explode  it would nt surprise me if many of these bastard politicians view such actions as a long term investment in their criminal justice systems and keeping their prisons filled  among other sinister motives  do these states  by chance  happen to reap any federal benefits from rampant populations growth  i know many red states get heavy federal subsidies it feels like there s more to it than concern for the  sanctity of life   perhaps i underestimate racism in the south 
0,funny  the only time i have personally heard the claim that planned parenthood was a conspiracysecret genocide of black people was from a professor that focused on black studies and who was herself black i also got to know a student who looked up to said professor as a mentor they both shared some of the most backwards  fuckedup  blmesque stances i have ever seen  this is not a conservative or liberal issue it s a misinformation issue people either make shit up to get what they want or they never bother finding out what s true or false before spouting shit to get what they want all dishonest sides will pull the same trick they want to break you down into groups so you re easier to control you can put any spin on any issue if you do nt care about the truth  here we see someone making an issue black and white while pretending to want to stop the issue from being black and white it is insane we have reached the point we have in politics everyone is contradicting themselves constantly the truth is the last thing they consider  i think the congresswoman made good points  and a gray stance would not bait as many clicks  but she is feeding the fire in her own way it is hypocritical and exhausting to see every day 
0,i love how people can talk about ethnic minorities ignorantly like they do nt fucking understand what a pregnancy is and what it means to take it to term  i remember a few years ago  political camwhore cory booker tried to live on foodstamps to prove that they were really shitty to be on and did nt do a lot for people when half these politicians are forced to work endlessly for shit hours because they do nt have the money to take time off  pay for constant checkups  carry a growing mass on their belly  gain weight  cut out their vices  smoking  drinking   stave off nausea on a regular basis  and then sit on a hospital bed in pain for multiple hours until they re shitting and their asshole tears and a kid comes out  i ll value their opinion on this as much as the opinions of the women who see what their future and what their fetuses  possible futures could look like  they can also adopt all the kids that are brought to term then given away  too just to be consistent surely that s why most of them are in the top 10

0,it is a simple fact that not only are abortion rates higher in countries where it is illegal  but also abortion related health complications and deaths for women increase dramatically in these places whatever your view on life  souls  zygotes being children or whatever it is a fact that making abortions safe and available reduce many immediate atrocious problems in society and the benefits clearly outweigh the cost

0,it s bad politics  but unfortunately it s almost requisite in a destructive groupthink environment like the modern republican party if you do nt pretend to treat the talking points as gospel and reject compromise like a baptist rejects satan  you re rejected from the group when people make decisions based on fear of reprisal  they re being bullied those republicans who make blind pledges to block anything the president wants  they re being bullied by their own party  and they re caving to the pressure i do nt mean to say the victims of this bullying are nt in some ways complicit i m saying they re cowards

0,all this is doing is encouraging simpleminded trump supporters to attack protestors in the hopes they ll get the opportunity to meet their phony hero i ca nt wait to watch trump get trounced in the general  fueled specifically by votes from the very people he denigrates

0,hillary delivers her hot button issues often repeated but with no details of how she could end racism or sexism she likes to talk about both 
0,electing obama did nt end racism  electing hillary wo nt end sexism  and electing bernie wo nt end antisemitism  so how about we vote on platforms rather than which bathroom the candidate uses 
0,it d be nice if the article included some context 
0,so apparently hillary clinton is going to end racism and sexism  that s what she s implying i think we can all see what s she s doing and how she s taking advantage of people it s really exploitative and toxic clinton does nt know how to not be a racist 
0,holy hell  that s some serious mental gymnastics 
0,ironically  proper wealth distribution and fixing income equality does wonders for racism and sexism 
0,gt  recently  hillary clinton  s most prominent surrogate  former president bill clinton  told a rally of her supporters that he still considered himself to be the first black president  and that the human genome showed  we are all mixraced people   wait  did this actually happen  if so  how did that get under the radar 
0, if we fixed this one thing  would it fix everything  no  so let s not do it   high fives goldman sachs lobbyist  hillary rodham clinton
0,no probably not however  it would weaken the current status quo which has continued to perpetuate racism and sexism 
0,would electing hillary end racism  sexism 
0,what the fuck is wrong with her  she is the most detached and oblivious person 
0,what the fuck kind of broken logic is that 
0,a candidate that says she is not a part of the problems in this country but the solution is telling us fixing the problems is a pipe dream 
0,if we discovered a way to make solar power 100  efficient  would that end racism  oh  i guess we should nt try then 
0,non sequitur misdirection logic  no 
0,animal cruelty would also persist after these financial institutions are broken up why does bernie hate kittens 
0,if we made hillary president tomorrow  would that end racism  would that end sexism 
0,no  it isnt designed to  but a more equal economy would help alleviate the worst effects of racism and sexism on minorities
0,it would end her donors  support 
0,would nt it be cool if breaking up the big banks actually did end racism and sexism that d be awesome 
0,no but it would stop too big to fail  banking 
0,it might rabbit  it might 
0,you did nt say it in your dream  carson you said it out loud on front of everyone you are awake this is the real life you were nt supposed to say it out loud 
0,this is such an obvious thing it almost has to go without saying if there was a republican president  the debate would ve gone like this   should president republican nominate a replacement justice   and then every candidate would ve said   of course  that s what the constitution says  if the democrats try to block the nomination they re clearly trying to impede democracy there s historical precedent of nominating justices  there s so much hypocrisy in modern politics it s disgusting at least admit that you only want obama to wait because he s not going to nominate a judge you agree with 
0,gt  carson said the supreme court has become a  political tool   adding that it might be time to look at term limits for the justices   when we enacted that program  the average age of death was 47 and now it  s 80 you know  things have changed  so we need to change with them   carson said  i m confused is ben carson making a well reasoned argument 
0,carson surprised me for once 
0,this precedent the gop speaks of  does not exist   http  wwwscotusblogcom201602supremecourtvacanciesinpresidentialelectionyears  
0,carson said something not crazy 
0,am i wrong or did they choose that photo as an homage to the kermit meme 
0,carson woke up just long enough to make a valid point but by the time the last word left his lips his eyes had returned to their familiar glazed appearance 
0,gt  then again  recognize that the two picks that the president has selected are ideologues  so there  s really no reason to believe that his next pick wouldn  t be an ideologue also  a  we d have to go back to anthony kennedy probably to find a supreme court nominee who was nt an ideologue  and even then  most were surprised kennedy s voting record turned out to be moderate  b  the president has nt picked yet therefore no one knows if this pick  who does not yet exist  is an ideologue  or not no one knows who it is  no one has had a chance to examine the person s record no one has had a chance to interview the person and to find out their thoughts and positions  basically  obama could pick someone so conservative that they make scalia seem like a bleedingheart liberal  and the republicans would still be opposed no on substance  but because its obama s pick they are opposed to everything obama does because obama did it they disagree with much of what obama does for substantive reasons  of course  but with all of it for the childish reason of trying to prevent obama from doing anything at all  even when they agree with him 
0,i respect him for being honest about this are we really expecting politicians to lie to us  that s terrible 
0,the voice of reason comes from the weirdest places sometimes

0,god damnit  mitch mcconnel is so mcawful that he s making me agree with ben carson  fuck off  you obstinate turtle 
0, carson said the supreme court has become a  political tool   adding that it might be time to look at term limits for the justices  holy fuck  ben carson just said something i actually  agree  with feels weird  man 
0,the egyptians would nt wait for the pharaoh to die to fill the pyramids with grain 
0,ben carson does nt want to be president  he wants to make a good show of things so he can charge tons of money in speaking fees that s called  pulling a palin  
0,i just want to say that this thumbnail is perfect 
0,does anyone else find it ironic that scalia would not agree with limiting terms of justices as carson throws out at the end 
0,i think most recognize he is allowed to nominate but the senate is still allowed to deny it
0,aw shit it must be the end times  because i agree with everything ben carson said in that article
0,jesus christ i ca nt think of a better thumbnail than that for this post he s like  i m just saying you know 
0,thank you  captain obvious 
0,i see they forgot to keep drugging his coffee 
0,of course is this really not common knowledge  do people really not realize it s an attempt to let a republican president nominate someone 
0, sips coffee  but thats none of my business 
0,he s entirely right  the only reason that republicans are complaining about obama being able to appoint a nominee for justice is because they fear that he ll pick someone that they do nt like  the republicans all agree that obama is  undermining the constitution   those are words taken straight from marco rubio s mouth   but when he has a  constitutional duty  to perform  they scream  he s gon na pick someone we do nt like  he should nt obey the law   hippocracy at its best 
0,of course not it s all posturing
0,lucid dreaming ftw 
0,scalia relied on textualism and originalism on the bench republicans loved him then  ben carson  who is seeking the republican nomination  says  things change  we should change with them  wut happen 2 originalism ben 
0,smartest thing he s ever said 
0,just saying
0,that has got to be the first god damn thing he s said that sounds sane the whole bit was very rational 
0,even a broken clock is right twice a day 
0,well duh seriously  they just need to drop the act  we re going to block anyone obama picks because he s a democrat and we re republicans and we do nt want them gaining any more power it s politics  just say it we already know it  seriously  i would respect them more if they would quit pretending it has something to do with the american people choosing 
0,why is he still running  he obviously does nt care about his image in the party anymore 
0,no one actually cares  no republican  be they voter or legislator  gives a shit about whether there s precedent for stalling like this  and most of them are nt even pretending to does it prevent obama from achieving his agenda  then they re for it it s that simple 
0,until the last 25 years or so  the increase in life expectancy was due to the decrease in infant mortality and childhood diseases if you survived until adulthood  your chance of a full life was pretty good

0,sleepy ben said what everyone already knew  risky bet ben  let s see how it plays out 
0,what happened to carson  
0, come on  ben  memorize your lines  and say only your lines   marco rubotio
0,wow the pubs sure are getting pretty good at blurting out the things that everybody already knows but denies 
0,no shit the democrats know this the gop knows this obama knows this my 8 year old even knows this everyone knows this this wo nt stop the gop from being a bunch of obstructionist hypocrites  however 
0,the real question is  how did the reporter manage to get a full quote  every single reporter who has interviewed carson dozed off half way into the first sentence 
0,not only did he call the gop a bunch of hypocrites  but he also put forth an argument against the whole conservative ideology at the end lol 
0,wait did fucken ben carson have a moment of lucidity and logic  something grounded in reality and an analysis of the situation argued from logos instead of ethos  holy fucken shit 
0,and democrats would stonewall the fuck out of them  what else is new

0,secretaries of state break up big banks 
0,to be fair al gore came to my town  that is in the netherlands  last year to speak they paid him   150k iirc  i did nt go  tickets were quite expensive but i was pretty shocked how much some people get paid for a less than two hour speech
0,since when does the secretary of state has to deal with breaking banks or not 
0,so we ve moved on to supposition articles now 
0,if he had clinton s resume and was nt trying to dismantle the banking system  absolutely it s not like she was the only person they paid to speak they had an entire speaker series featuring successful people from diverse backgrounds 
0,secretary of state is foreign policy  she was nt the damn secretary of treasury  holy hell the misinformation and bad thought processes
0,the secretary of state is being taken to task for notbreaking up domestic banks  this is officially the dumbest anticlinton thing on rpolitics this week 
0,absolutely you are out of your minds if you think bankers are nt going to want to hear the outgoing treasury secretary speak 
0,i am fairly certain that if bernie sanders had been treasury secretary  that he would have been courted for speeches to banking events no matter what type of policy he had 
0,if goldman sachs is run by  say  surly junior high kids or ted cruz  yeah  i would nt pay to hear from enemies  if  however  i wanted to get a perspective of someone who did  indeed  regulate my business and lower my profit margin  i would want hear from them i would want to know their unvarnished perspective as the winner  in order to alter my strategy this is because i m a grownup  this does nt have anything to do with hilary  just that the premise of the title assumes that fifth graders run the world which  granted  may be true 
0,no  a bank would nt want someone who s actively trying to stop them from profiting so handsomely speaking at their institution  because you know exactly what a bernie speech to goldman sachs would sound like 
0,this speaking program is not some big secret you can go  look at their website   http  wwwgoldmansachscomourthinkingtalksatgs  for lots of information the point  according to one redditor who worked at a big bank  is simply  getting famous people to draw potential clients   https  npredditcomrpoliticscomments45xcbkwhile_clinton_and_many_on_the_left_decryd00xb90  context  3   the speakers are famous people of all stripes  prominent athletes  scientists  retired military  entrepreneurs  russel simmons  dean kamen   the archbishop of canterbury  etc  there are some leftyoutsider people too such as amory lovins and linda hirshman  but in general not that many are politicians because not that famous 
0,not a fan of hilary and do nt believe she has any desire to be super tough against big moneycorporationsbanks or whatever  but her job as secretary of state had nothing to do with the economy 
0,gt  if this sounds strange  let s imagine a slightly different scenario suppose bernie sanders had spent four years in president obama s cabinet during which time he did everything he could to try to break up the big banks and have corporate criminals put behind bars does anyone believe goldman sachs would pay him  250000 to recount his experiences  yes 
0,yes hillary clinton completely failed in her capacity as secretary of the treasury jesus fucking christ guys  quit shoving this shit down my throat 
0,why do we need to break up the big banks  it s not like tesla and apple and amazon and all the big companies can bank at the neighborhood credit union if we orderly capital markets and a strong economy we have to have the big banks 
0,ridiculous and obtuse argument but does nt matter because fuck hillary      _    _  
0,so she was an awful sos because she did nt break up big banks 
0,this article is just the consistent  hillary takes money from big banks  argument  only reworded poorly and framed in a way that makes no sense
0,secretary of state has nothing to do with domestic financial institutions people in this thread are so dumb 
0,yes  well maybe not 250k since he wasnt first lady as well  but there would probably be a big interest in getting him as speaker too
0,why would you think bernie would do that  there s a huge difference between what a politician with no real power will say versus what one will actually do once he is in power 
0,you people are the worst get past her speaking circuit money talk about a more interesting nonissue like her terrible yellow coat 
0,gt  it s not just that the politician wants to act to curry the favor of the rich and powerful  more typically they identify with the interests of the rich and powerful so that they do nt even see themselves as compromising a principle  gt  when we actually see money being handed over to politicians from the wealthy  whether in the form of large speaking fees or a highpaying job  it is probably best to think of it as analogous to a valentine present no one loves their spouse or significant other because of a generous valentine gift  rather it is a symbol of ongoing affection 
0,self posts not allowed oh wait unless it s from a corporate entity it is
0,yes  they just want to throw money around for the fun of it have you not watch the wolf of wall street 
0,not the best analogy being in the cabinet does nt mean you just get to do whatever you want you d probably have to stay in your lane  how about   bernie sanders spent his 30year political career not just talking about income inequality and the necessity of government regulation on big banks  but acting on it does anyone believe goldman sachs would pay him  250000 to recount his experiences  
0,gt  suppose bernie sanders had spent four years in obama s cabinet and tried to break up the big banks does anyone believe goldman sachs would pay him  250000 to recount his experiences  except hillary did nt say that by all accounts given so far  it was more a rahrah speech than it was her telling goldman of her accounts of trying to break up the big banks so this entire statement is based on a false supposition 
0,i find it funny how almost every comment here is making fun of the stupidity of this post and article yet the article has 4000 points  87  liked  and is sitting at the top of reddit 
0,we ran out of everything else and now we re down to making up shit entirely eh 
0,the top comments in this thread are all people who only read the quote and not the entire article smh
0,wtf what a stupid argument clinton was sec state  not the sec treasury or head of any regulatory agency so she would nt be doing anything to threaten banks they likley had her speak bc she s a clinton  been around and former sec state  even if she was a regulator  it would nt surprise me if she would speak at a banking event  and any  breaking up of banks  would be bc congress came up with a law with regs requiring them to divest themselves of certain busiensses  ie reinstating glass  steagall provisions 
0,are you kidding  of course they would  why do you think it s the toughest most vicious prosecutorsregulators get hired by the banks  not only do poachers make the best gamekeepers  but it also takes them out of the equation if gs offered bernie a million to do some work for them it would make it much harder for him to come down on them later 
0,hillary is a status quo presidential candidate  if she gets the nomination and the job things will remain mostly as they are with little attempt to change them  the big banks know this 
0,just another way of saying what bernie said in the last debate   i m paraphrasing   i guess these banks just love to throw away money  right   it s obvious to anyone who will think about it  but plenty of people are invested in not thinking about it 
0,know thine enemy so yes they would he would most likely refuse it regardless if he was retired or not 
0,you mean  650k
0,i thing goldman sachs is double playing you all 250k is absolutely nothing to them but it is enough to appear to support hillary without really helping her this obviously actually hurts her and helps sanders  the one they really want in office because they can us him to suck the blood out of our economy and send us into depression  where sachs will profit massively 
0,exactly this  if i do not explicitly see it  it does nt exist  mantra is ridiculously short sighted i ve said the same thing before  probably on here   the politicians that do literally change their vote for cash  seem to be the ones that get caught the goal of the money is to bring these people into the same social strata as those with the money make them part of the club the more they hang out  the more washed over with those ideals they will be dishonesty is not a simple process 
0,ofcoursenothetalkstoslow 
0,sanders supporters  one problem is that some of us ca nt get on board with the evil wall street stuff it s very difficult legally to say exactly why and how you re going to prosecute bankers for what happened in 2008 it s very difficult to craft regulations to correct exactly the things we want without having either very bad unintended consequences  or loopholes that render them useless i see it as a problem we have as a country  and something we really need to think about and be smart about bernie actually kinda scares me with his us vs them stuff  if you have the time  take a look at  this video   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  qclmwlgcgg0  of a slightly boring economist who s studied the problem extensively to me this is kind of talk and approach we need if we really want to solve the problem sure  it s not a rousing as bernie s power to the people  stuff  but there you go let the republicans have their demagogues  someone needs to be the smart party 
0,i think it would be money well spent they can learn about his mindset and how to take evasive action for next time 
0,if he actually tried to break up the banks  getting a detailed debriefing of what worked  did nt work  and his thoughts on the matter   250k would be a bargain  think about it if you ran a company with billions in profit  and you spent millions on lobbying  paying think tanks  and other expensive tactics to prevent legislation and regulatory action against it spending  250k to find out from the other side what is actually working and not working would worth every penny 
0,does no one here remember anything that happened back when the clintons were still in arkansas  anyone that wants this person to be the leader of the   free world   has either had their head in the sand for the past 40 years  does nt pay attention to the history of this family  does nt care  or is probably under the age of 25 
0,that is so good  it should be in rshowerthoughts people are starting to wake up   
0,absofuckinglutely the correct question is do you think he d take it
0,if i were a wall street wolf  i would pay 250k for them to tell me how they tried to stop me  so i could learn more about how to defend my stake  and also because 250k is chump change 
0,every economist believes this is not going to do anything another big bank will just come up a few years after i think effective legislationlaws is a better action 
0,gt  the wages of other workers would fall since displaced manufacturing workers would be forced to look for jobs in retail and other sectors the increased supply of workers lowers wages in these other sectors as well recent research by some of the country s top labor economists confirms that trade has been a major factor depressing the wages of large numbers of workers  step 1  have your husband  as president  champion legislation that ships manufacturing to china step 2  walmart becomes the country s largest employer of new lowwage workers step 3  get on the board of directors at walmart step 4  profit  step 5  run for president

0,ok guys  i love bernie but this is a random unscientific online poll that is about as meaningful as a poll of reddit users 
0,i do nt know why clinton and her campaign believes that the south is going to be a safe haven for her  you see  the thing about southern democrats is that they share alot of thoughts and feelings with southern republicans that live all around them  every day  for their entire lives  if you keep on hearing and seeing people talk about how much they hate hillary clinton as southern democrats do when they re around southern republicans  some of that will eventually seep in

0,with all due respect to mr jackson  he has a misunderstanding of young voters grasp on hrcs history 
0,this is from 2008  right  oh  no it s just history repeating itself 
0,i think bill clinton is an eloquent speaker and profound thinker i wish he would mount a new topic every day 
0,if she did nt know her husband had a loose cannon by now  there s just no excuse 
0,the  mixed race  comment is odd but not completely out of line  notwithstanding the criticism of the random  democratic blogger  they quoted more damaging is probably his claim that hillary clinton is a  changemaker  who can get things done where president obama could not  for two primary reasons  1 anything that she can accomplish with an overwhelmingly republican congress will come at the expense of the voters she is courting in the democratic primary  2 it illustrates an undeserved smugness as well as disdain for president obama s accomplishments it also demonstrates that her attack on senator sanders for being insufficiently supportive of the president is disingenuous political theater 
0,gt  in response  aaron camp  a democratic blogger  wrote   for  mr clinton  to claim that we are all mixed race people    is dismissive of the serious problem of racism and racial inequality in this country  and  as a matter of fact  racist  valid point but i could nt care less what a  blogger  has to say 
0,and i think 99  of bernie sanders  supporters would be just as happy  if not happier  with warren 
0,i believe they probably have discussed this between the two of them and decided that bernie would run for whatever reasons 
0,he s going to make her secretary of the treasury  hopefully 
0,please give bernie some credit for daring this  radical  campaign   i do nt think it was an battle to lose to begin with and it is nt now i admire his courage more 
0,warren is most effective in the senate 
0,i m not sure she would have a chance against clinton though the reason bernie has been so effective is because of his recordrhetoric she does nt have the record 
0,was nt sanders recruited to run by the people who started the draft warren group after she firmly declined to run 
0, if thing that did not happen had happened  then other thing that did happen might not have happened  great reporting 
0,there were a ton of people who should have run  but did nt bother because the process seemed set up for hillary to win who saw kerryedwards coming in 2004  historically way more people on both sides have been willing to give it a shot and see how it goes  turning the nominating process into hillary s coronation was a huge mistake 
0,i ve been a bernie fan since he arrived in congress in 1991 but i would have been perfectly happy with warren as a candidate she s better known and bernie did not want to run i listened to the onceaweek brunch with bernie hour on the thom hartmann radio show and bernie kept hoping a progressive like warren would run when no one came forward  he began talking about running himself

0,before i opened the link i bet myself  50 that the economist was gerald friedman steak dinner for me  but seriously friedman is a yesman for sanders  i can find plenty of economists  scott sumner  robert murphy etc  that would strongly disagree with this  edit  his video is full of the usual leftwing talking points  high marginal tax rates led to growth   these arguments have been easily refuted many times  effective tax rates are similar to today  way more deductions and more lenient tax code  only two brackets where the 90  kicked in over 23 million in todays terms etc  the growth statistics he puts forth are not just generous  they are absolutely insane the median income will not grow by 22k  you do nt have to be an economist to realize that 
0,i do nt have to be an economist to realize that doing something other then what we are doing now would probably be better
0,eventually  absolutely but it s going to be a rocky road in the mean time as big  throws everything they have at him to discredit and make him look weak fixing the corruption in this country is nt going to be fast or easy and will take everyone biting the bullet for a while we need to pursue what is right instead of the almighty buck 
0,here comes the trumpets
0,i think we should respect opinions of economists who have actually made a lot of money during their careers this gentleman is clearly not one of them 
0,a socialist economist defending a socialist candidate s plan it s no surprise that the numbers put forth are  irreconcilable with the findings of the tax foundation  six million jobs lost  gdp shrinking nearly 10   wages dropping with 43   and six   http  taxfoundationorgsitestaxfoundationorgfilesdocstaxfoundationff498pdf  on his tax plan alone  i do nt hear any real mention of the private sector aside from trucks not breaking down professor friedman seem to completely ignore the fact that three million jobs are left unfilled in the us because there are no qualified  technicallyschooled workers available he seems to ignore that there s a world out there full of countries that wo nt tax these companies to death  bernie s economic plans are lethal to america s credit  american jobs  american families  and american business is free college so enticing  it does nt even guarantee you a job these days

0,what a great endorsement for trump bush and now obama attacking him just cements him as antiestablishment 
0,president obama was very civilized about it  gt   i continue to believe mr trump will not be president and the reason is because i have a lot of faith in the american people and i think that they recognize that being president is a serious job   obama said 
0,classy  is nt the president normally reserved on giving their opinion of the upcoming general election

0,thank you so much presdent obama  you just made more trump supporters  and made him the candidate  there are people that voted for you 2x mr obamathat now support trump 100   as for insulting people that support trump its democracy mr president democracy many people like bill clinton were insulting your supporters when you were running too mr obama  as a trump supporter  sorry that trump triggered you mr president i am sure thats why you are considered a weak president on many issues like isis  terrorism  immigration  and even how divided the country more on race issues blacks think you were a disappointment mr obama  please dont cry again like you literally do  mr obama you are fired in 9 months anyways 
0,jesus what is this thread  is there a lot more trump supporters here than i thought 
0,for the people here saying  this will help trump   that s what obama is aiming to do  whoever the democratic nominee is  obama  wants  himher to go up against trump in the general trump is the candidate most likely to selfimplode  even against a meek democratic candidate  let s dispel with this fiction that president obama does nt know what he s doing 
0,obama  you re fired 
0, let me insult a couple prominent members of the senate and then complain about it when they do nt follow me along when i refuse to compromise 
0,honestly  today i had a panic attack when it hit me  we ve all been treating trump like an impossible side show candidate but dear god  he could actually do it the american people really are stupid enough that he could win and not only that the man is dangerous dangerous to world peace  dangerous to minorities  dangerous to human rights  i ca nt keep laughing about this 
0,this article hits at my major reservation with clinton i do nt doubt her capability  i doubt her commitment to addressing of the concerns of my generation much of what young voters want is at odds with the clintonian  new democrats    third way  political triangulation 
0, in truth  our affluent  establishment democrats can no more be budged from their core dogmas  that education is the solution to all problems  that professionals deserve to lead  that the downfall of the working class is the inevitable price we pay for globalization  than creationists can be wooed away from the tenets of  intelligent design  
0,not bad for theguardian i like the last bit about the dogma of the left   education is the solution to all problems   not when preaching the wrong thing  edit  which was what the article was getting at  il admit i spedread
0,this  and another article  really describe to me the difference between clintonera thought and sanders thought clinton economics is to have unfettered capitalist coupled with biggovernment welfare in the form of transfer payments to those harmed by capitalism sanders favors a more fair form of capitalism that is restrained  designed to not allow people to become billionaires instead of transfer payments funded by taxes  he would rather see more opportunities with their cost baked into the pricing of goods and services  i prefer the sanders approach because it is tenable everyone hates high taxes to fund welfare payments it is better to put more people to work with an economy that is designed to do this rather than one designed to make a few people insanely rich 
0,if the democrats were against inequality  they would nt have given the shareholders of major financial corporations billions of dollars in free money over the past 8 years 
0,gt  that the downfall of the working class is the inevitable price we pay for globalization this is clinton s ethos so sorry  working class  but your suffering and futility is the price so that we can have our multinationals and cheap consumer shit but we all know  the elite are the real victims of globalization they get to see their fellow citizens suffer and die and it s the elite that has to deal with that burden 
0,so if republican establishment serves the 1  and democrat establishment serves the 10   1  inclusive   that leaves the 90  without any representation sounds like a cause for revolution to me it s just a republicrat money grab and some of you have been fooled to think it s different

0,if she ran she would have won 
0,i love warren for the same reason i love sandersunvarnished straight talk that is both believable and not self serving both of them are people i would want to be friends with because i feel i could call them when facing a difficult decision or moral dilemma and get some advice that would likely solve the problem  i feel that clinton would give me advice she could either profit from or use against me in the future 
0,most bernie supporters wanted her first it is not that they do nt want hillary because she is a woman  they do nt want her because she is calculating rather than principled  opportunistic as opposed to moral

0,what s sad is that the damage the lead poisoning causes is nt really treatable i ve heard that they can kind of remove the lead from a person s body  but the brain damage is irreversible forgot to mention that the damage is done mostly to children  because it stops their brain from developing properly  i first heard about it on npr  it was  this   http  wwwnprorg20160122463929541leadpoisoningdatesbacktoromantimes  interview  this   http  wwwnprorg20151018449747061lessonsfromafighttofixflintswatersupply  one is also pretty good 
0,the comments from the parent about the decline in their child s ability to focus and do their schoolwork was heartbreaking  the fact is that the local and state government decided to turn their heads how much did the federal government know  and how long ago  all these government officials turning their heads and acting like this whole situation is frightening to say the least why did they do it  special interests  lobbyists  was it because the majority of the community was poor and they figured nobody would care  was it racially motivated  all of the above  one has to wonder if this is happening elsewhere in the us these political officials do nt give a rat s ass about communities that do nt contribute to their campaigns  it s time for a change

0, your town is a shithole   crowd cheers 
0,too bad sanders is nt part of the legislative branch  then he just might be in a position to do something about it 
0,it is  after all  the present year 
0,im a sanders supporter and the 1st thing i thought of was the communities response when hillary did this  my question is with all his talk wtf is bernie going to do right now not when he wins but right now  if he just talks about it honestly hes no better than hillary
0,i like how when sanders does something it s good and totally not for political reasons however  when clinton does something it s a political side show and she is only doing it to get votes 
0,i mean cmon ppl its 2016
0,well sanders  the predominant areas are all in cities controlled by one party and controlled by that same party for decades it is a real shame but it never came to light until they could try and pin it on a republican during an election cycle
0,and they knew  all the way up to the federal epa for months without telling people they were drinking poisoned water they took this time to argue over who s fault it was rather than to come up with a fix  this is nt a failure or one city or one state  it is a failure of government 
0,he s meeting with them now and he did nt know  has nt this been going on for a while 
0,got it hillary goes to flint  to see the people and condemms the situation vote grabbing just trying to get the checkoff for minorities and articles calling her out saying it was for other reasons sanders goes to flint  because he s a great man and condemms the situation  goodness out of his own heart and ttly not related to his political aspirations 
0,think how much  and of importance  will be  how much of flint  michigan s future has already been washed away with poisoned water a generation of young people whose potential has been capped by a lead ceiling they will struggle against for the rest of their lives are we not already engaged in a civil war  of which this is but one of many similar conflicts  this is not peace people at peace do not kill and maim each other with poison 
0,wow  bernie disagrees with poisoning people   just like me      feel the bern
0,the government has horribly failed their citizens what we need now  is bigger government to fix the problem 
0,i do nt like the  think about the children   line how about we re poisoning everyone in the region 
0,i am surprised that none of the billionaires in this country have thought to give back to an american city in need  the american people would love anyone who could do that public universities and private foundations could compete for the prestige of making flint great again 
0,gt  mr sanders said that he didn  t want to be  overly political  but that he had called for the resignation of gov rick snyder of michigan   if the local government can not protect those children  if the state government can not protect those children  then the federal government better   he said  oh really  well you just politicized it dipshit um is nt this a utility and a failure of local government  the federal government would do the exact same thing as the governor and delegate responsibility locally what party was running the city  nevermind i already know the answer  fuck you bernie you re so full of shit

0,whether im in one of my libertarian moods or proconsumer liberal moods  im proud to always disagree with paul krugman 
0,i think that krugman simply fails to see what s happening  that sleepy america is gradually waking up to the fact that its system of government is badly broken and has to change krugman is a very smart economist  but he s looking at things through the prism of  business as usual  bernie s underlying premise is that  business as usual  has failed government needs to change  and he is leading the call for change it is about  the will of the people 
0,sanders clearly has  happy dreams   why else would he pay his interns less than the  15hour minimum wage he wants to force on the country 
0,to be fair  krugman s a staunch neoliberal so of course he s going to speak out against bernie s economic plans
0,to be fair  krugman is sort of a dumb guy

0, me      republican heads explode    
0,as i posted on a different thread  i can not recall  or google  a supreme court candidate being nominated twice hence  if the senate is sincere about rejecting any and all nominees then whoever obama puts forward will be sacrificed it makes for an interesting decision in the white house  nominate the most appropriatedeserving and potentially lose them forever  or nominate a second tier candidate

0,40  of those polled are still undecided  sc will be a lot closer than nh was 
0,bernie needs to win nevada 
0,better than a 40 or 50 point lead like a month ago she s dropping fast  poll has an a on 538
0,looks like clinton is doing well in states that wo nt vote democrat in the general election 
0,after living in south carolina for a year and keeping in touch with people there  i would nt be ecstatic about this if i were a clinton supporter maybe  i d stick with  clinton is favored by 18 points in  a state    i ve got no hate for sc but  let s be honest  even the progressives there average about 30 years behind the curve of liberal culture 
0,only 40  of likely democratic voters have decided who they are voting for though and only 34  of likely black voters have decided i think that bodes well for bernie who has a much better ground game  source  http  wwwcnncom20160216politicssouthcarolinapollcnnorcindexhtml the part i referred to is near the bottom
0,not too terrible considering clinton was expecting to crush sanders into the dirt in sc just a few weeks ago  sc might actually be a nail biter if he keeps gaining 
0,and this is where clinton is supposed to be strongest  she s plummeted the last 2 months in sc
0,the outcome in nevada will weigh heavily on those who have not decided  about a third of black voters  34   say they have decided on a candidate versus nearly 6 in 10 white voters  57      http  wwwcnncom20160216politicssouthcarolinapollcnnorcindexhtml 
0,i need something explained to me from people in the know  why is sander s support so low among blacks  he has been a civil rights activist for as long as we can find records of him has marched with civil rights leaders of the day has been consistent on all of his platforms  what do blacksminorities know that i do not  where should i be looking for stories to explain this  i need some sources on this please i ca nt find sources to adequately explain this to me 
0,hillary s campaign is essentially 3 vs 1  bill and chelsea are continuously sent out to do hillary s dirty work  sanders campaign can rebuff bill  but rebuffing chelsea would undoubtedly result in the clintons labelling him a sexist creeper  luckily they ve been smart enough to avoid that trap 
0,6point margin of error  jesus 
0,a lot of undecided voter will play an advantage to bernie

0,victory   
0,her lead is shrinking every day she will be crushed when it comes time for south carolina they re only a few more days and he is slowly slowly coming up on her i think her campaign is in shambles right now and they re really feeling it we re going to see who the true nominee will be clinton is no queen but we are going to see who s going to be crowned king and i will be bernie sanders he is going to be reckoning that this country needs 
0,why pollsters assume a youge black turnout  according to cnn poll  hillary leading among blacks  6528  meanwhile bernie leads among whites  5440   overall result is 5638  so if turnout ratio is 5050 hillary should lead by 65 points  52546   why in the earth black folks will turnout for hillary more than they did for obama back in 2008 primaries
0,clinton is an unethical fraudster fact 
0,not to say this is nt a good result for hillary it is but the trendlines have got to be worrying for her campaign she had a 31 point lead in october and now it s down to 18 points 40  of democratic voters are still trying to decide  so there s room for a potentially big swing  hillary will very likely win sc but the question is by how much i m expecting a low to mid double digit win for her at this point if sanders can hold her to single digits in sc  that will be big 
0,the number of hillary canvassers positively dwarfs the number of sanders canvassers bernie s online support does nt stretch out to the real world

0,god the lack of good polls pisses me off  i have no idea how to feel about nevada

0,of course they are the reality is that the more latinos and blacks learn about sanders  the more likely they will vote for him the only hurdle for them is awareness sanders  policies will make their lives better  period clinton s policies will just be the same old dc bullshit would you choose a better life or a shit life

0,hillary won the popular vote 
0,heh strange how vox quotes  latino firewall  in the headline but not in the article and in no way makes any indication of whom they re quoting i do nt believe i ve ever heard clinton use the term  latino firewall  so as for now  that s just vox saying stupid shit for clicks which is par for course

0,yes  let s all vote for the old white career politician 
0,that reads like a proclinton push poll it did nt even ask about which candidate they d support  luckily it was nt a telephone survey  although pushpolling by telephone is also a thing  it s taking things pretty far  even for an unscientific survey  gt  1  sanders could be elected as president in november  as americans reject concerns over his identity as a  democratic socialist  okay  strong opening  gt  2  clinton is a betterqualified candidate because of her experience as the wife of a president  a senator and secretary of state  oh dear  if you were expecting a question here also regaling sanders  past career and marital status  you d be mistaken  gt  3  both candidates are actively vying for the votes of africanamericans those voters have better reasons to support  okay  without controlling for demographics  this does nt mean _anything_ gt  4  it is important to me that clinton be elected this year as the first woman president in us history  oh my

0,i m willing to bet that most of hillary supporters  or any nonbernie supporters  who have nt seen a single video of bernie will at least entertain the idea of jumping ship once they do see one of his videos  i like this one in particular   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  ru3nkvvxcss

0,the same thing happen to mewhen i saw a donal trump video  now i m for him 
0,i would like to see some more realistic  pragmatic ideas rather than vague populist rhetoric every reddit article is the same kind of thing   bernie is right on poverty  i think it s bad to be poor  and people should be able to have money to buy things   i mean  i see a lot of complaints and virtually no plausible solutions being offered from bernie i m very skeptical of this kind of politician i appreciate his detachment from corporate benefactors in his campaign  though and  i think he does care  where i think hillary is probably a more shrewd politician rather than some compassionate visionary

0,wow how limited do you have to be to totally swayed by one viewing of a video 
0,voting for someone because of a facebook video nice 
0,she cared   more   about his passionoratory not about the content 
0,there is certainly an age gap going on here it seems as if the only retort that hillary supporters can muster is  young people are too naive to know that they should support clinton  this seems similar to their other arguments  eg  women who support bernie are not real feminists  men who support bernie are sexist  berniebros    considering the incredible skill that young people have in accessing good and relativelyunbiased information quickly using modern technology  the position that young people are naive or underinformed seems to fall flat considering older generations  reliance on outdated information media technologies for their information  media that is largely controlled by corporate clinton supporters  it may be that it is the older generation of voters who are both naive and underinformed  i d like to hear other people s thoughts on this 
0,i still fail to see how the sex of the potus is in any way relevant 
0,anyone who votes for hillary clinton because she s a woman is what s wrong with this country if you took even 1 hour to do some research on who your electing for to be the freaking commander and chief of our country you would realize that bernie is way more trustworthy of your vote then hillary the lord of lies 
0,a woman president lifts the glass ceiling for literally one person any president who is committed to helping women can help women  regardless of gender 
0,i know reddit just  loves  hitler comparisons by inference  but hitler  strom thurmond  even donald trump are passionate speakers that alone is not enough  i m not lumping sen sanders in that group  but i get actively pissed reading insipid supporter perspectives like this  no matter who the candidate of topic is  be it a feel the berner or a tea bagger  we get the democracy we deserve  if we do nt dug deeper than a passionate message  i fear even a donald trump could be considered a politically viable candidate 
0,this sub and the people on it are literally the worst  bernie sanders wipes his mouth politely after eating a sandwich   4500 upvotes  bunch of antitrade  ca nt do math  think taxes are only paid by businesses  free health care  even though you re 20 and have about a 00001  chance of needing serious medical coverage  wanting morons 
0,it s pretty obvious pandering here by bernies social media team  looking for the black vote ahead of sc watch this kind of racial political news hit the front page everyday 
0,i m from the uk so i do nt know too much about us politics a few months ago  i d never heard in the last of bernie sanders  but everything i have seen and heard in the last few weeks makes me hope for the sake of the us  and the world  that bernie wins  there is so much crap going on in the world right now  and he seems the only genuine chance the us people have of starting to get things right 
0,gt  sanders  support is more pronounced among young women especially one survey showed women voters under 35 preferred sanders by an almost 20point margin  while young men preferred him only by 4 points  so in fact  ms  steinem  not where all the boys are 
0,wow  the older voters in this audio are condescending as all hell to millenials 
0,hitler was also a passionate and consistent speaker  i do nt use that as my major decision point when electing someone 
0,i too think everything should be free for me and paid for by others

0,so she wants a token female in the oval office  yeah because that will solve all gender equality issues 
0,obama was a great speaker  passionate  and spoke of change  but history is useless  clearly  if no one remembers it in 8 years 
0,it s especially humorous because it s only  older democratic women  are  supposed  to go blindly hillary s way  because it s time for a woman candidate to be elected  men seem to be strangely irrelevant no  it s just that voters can actually do whatever they feel like  amazingly and bernie sanders tells the truth and we like it and hillary s simply a skilled politician  although i realize most of you poor sap s ignore it anyway but enough of them  believe me  are listening intently  and are voting with their feet for bernie

0,the dnc is in a tight spot they ve put a lot of time  money  and effort into clinton  and are now increasingly willing to send good money after bad if they think that there s still a chance that they can pull clinton out of her nosedive to get her the nomination  they can similarly delude themselves into thinking that  by the general  the email thing will have blown over  especially if clinton herself has not been candid with the democratic leadership about what was on that system because  she  believes that they will have no choice but to back her if she can get the nomination  do nt operate under the assumption that just because the dnc establishment wants hillary as the nominee and hillary wants the support of the dnc that either trusts the other  honestly  one of the more damning things for clinton was the house gop taking a step back and just saying   you know what  we think the fbi s got this covered 
0,her supporters have admitted as such by saying there is no way the administration would prosecute if a crime is determined to have been committed and no charges are brought  that s the definition of protection

0,but i thought kashkari was a goldmansachs shill s you can read his full remarks  here   https  wwwminneapolisfedorgnewsandeventspresidentsspeecheslessonsfromthecrisisendingtoobigtofail  gt  i believe we must begin this work now and give serious consideration to a range of options  including the following  breaking up large banks into smaller  less connected  less important entities  turning large banks into public utilities by forcing them to hold so much capital that they virtually can  t fail  with regulation akin to that of a nuclear power plant   taxing leverage throughout the financial system to reduce systemic risks wherever they lie 
0,pretty funny rpolitics is all over kashkari right now  but when he ran as a republican for governor of california back in 2014 he was labeled a shill and considered to be one of the worst men in california 
0,you know sanders campaign is having an effect on this country from top to bottom when headlines like this start popping up try and imagine seeing a headline like this back in 2006  it sounds ridiculous to even think about 
0,oh  so now we re listening to former goldman sachs employees and members of the fed  that s interesting 
0,wanting to place an arbitrary limit on the size of financial institutions is one of the strangest ideas to gain mainstream acceptance in the field of economics  the problem is not that banks are too big  it s that they re too leveraged  given the networking effects involved in finance  having 10 overleveraged small banks may not be any better than having one big overleveraged bank it may actually be easier to regulate and monitor the big one 
0,this is called damage control banks and the fed know reform is coming it s better to control your own fate than let others do it for you 
0,people forget that the federal reserve bank    is not    a government organization it is a privately owned institution it is  the  big bank 
0,he s wrong about  not seeing the next crisis   banks are still selling cdo s and we re due for another housing bubble it wo nt be as bad as the last one due to consumer confidence being low and inhibiting the unbridled optimism that fueled the last one rest assured that we can expect more of the same when the markets correct again
0,there is only one issue i have with what he said and perhaps some on who has a higher degree in economics than i do can explain why i m wrong  i have a minor in economics but does nt increased capital requirements mean banks have much less money to lend thus reducing the amount of money in existence  in economic terms anyway  and thus inflating the value of the dollar  since there is less of it in circulation  causing exports to weaken and imports to strengthen and if my understanding serves one of the problems of the recession was that bank credit simply dried up would nt this idea lead to a similar thing happening  also how small are we talking of making these banks  because economies of scale are still important to keep in mind when redistributing the banking system 
0,this is what they called nationalizing the banks usually we re very clear that we want the government to stay out of our personal finances

0,and i think 99  of bernie sanders  supporters would be just as happy  if not happier  with warren 
0,i believe they probably have discussed this between the two of them and decided that bernie would run for whatever reasons 
0,most bernie supporters wanted her first it is not that they do nt want hillary because she is a woman  they do nt want her because she is calculating rather than principled  opportunistic as opposed to moral 
0,he s going to make her secretary of the treasury  hopefully 
0,if she ran she would have won

0,warren is most effective in the senate 
0,i love warren for the same reason i love sandersunvarnished straight talk that is both believable and not self serving both of them are people i would want to be friends with because i feel i could call them when facing a difficult decision or moral dilemma and get some advice that would likely solve the problem  i feel that clinton would give me advice she could either profit from or use against me in the future

0, if thing that did not happen had happened  then other thing that did happen might not have happened  great reporting 
0,there were a ton of people who should have run  but did nt bother because the process seemed set up for hillary to win who saw kerryedwards coming in 2004  historically way more people on both sides have been willing to give it a shot and see how it goes  turning the nominating process into hillary s coronation was a huge mistake 
0,i was all in for warren  signed the petition to ask her to run she said no and we got bernie happy with either one
0,i ve been a bernie fan since he arrived in congress in 1991 but i would have been perfectly happy with warren as a candidate she s better known and bernie did not want to run i listened to the onceaweek brunch with bernie hour on the thom hartmann radio show and bernie kept hoping a progressive like warren would run when no one came forward  he began talking about running himself 
0,ever consider that maybe elizabeth warren did nt run because bernie was going to run 
0,warren for vp  sanders  warren 2016
0,alright  i got ta jump in here i know that most of reddit absolutely loves warren  but she is just as big of a politico as clinton or rubio i m from a small suburb of boston  and i guarantee if you mentioned it to her  she would nt know where it is she does nt do much  in my opinion  for the commonwealth she represents  opting instead to work for national causes  she s a carpet bagging technocrat from harvard law who was crowned  just like clinton  by the dnc amp  dccc to take ted kennedy s seat back from scott brown  who won it by beating the last anointed ma senate candidate  martha coakley  who was acting like hrc is now when she was campaigning  like she inherited the job   i know on the national stage she is a progressive hero  but as somebody she is supposed to represent right now  i feel that she is using massachusetts like so many other aspirational politicians  patrick  romney  brown  callahan  etc   stepping on our heads on the way to dc

0,i m really hoping sanders picks her as a running mate  if she d accept   she s a fabulous politician though having her in the senate may allow her to affect more 
0,i knew and loved warren before i ever heard of sanders  but i think he has a better chance than warren would ve while he has the age and jewish thing against him  warren has almost no history in politics compared to clinton  elected to senate in 2013  and the difference would ve been far starker

0,currently in nc the only health insurance provider  blue cross and blue shield  for about 1015 eastern counties is going to cease to do business there  so people with preexisting conditions who were finally able to get insurance due to the aca are now being told they will have no coverage within their own county so their only recourse is to travel hours away from their own towns and buy insurance  then whenever they get sick to drive those same hours to see a doctor at all the aca was great for a lot of reasons but it is still very lacking and we need to move forward on true universal health care  not universal health insurance 
0,insurance is expensive 
0,well we could take down the healthcare monopolies and then allow for capitalism to way down the cost allowing for healthcare providers to compete statewide would help these two would see a cost reduction and open up insurance to people who may not be able to afford it now i does nt have to be universal health care to work  it just ca nt have the monopolies they have now 
0,it only serves to help feeding the doctors who get artificial monopoly with government controlled supply if you want more coverage  allow more medical schools and students instead of subsidizing their monopoly i guess aipac has it under total control with this liberal narrative though
0,if medicaid expansion had been mandatory as in the original law  i think obamacare would be doing a much better job  however complying with the regulations made the private insurance market pretty brutal as far as sticker shock goes the new normal is a highdeductible plan  which incurs a lot more out of pocket lump payouts trying to meet that deductible if you  have health insurance  with a  3000 deductible  you can still easily go bankrupt when that bill hits  if not immediately then somewhere along the journey to your  10000 out of pocket maximum for the year  i have a middleclass job but the only way i could pay for the outofpocket expenses to treat my wife s cancer was borrowing from my 401k  most people are nt so lucky  situations like this are just so unfuckingnecessary that it s incredibly frustrating if america ca nt figure out affordable universal healthcare like every other wealthy country  then america is nt that freaking great 
0,yeah my deductible for going to the er is insanely high so high i could nt pay it anyway so no insurance is the real life reality
0,i had high hopes for the aca  but it has not done anything for me all the plans are either too expensive for me or have very high deductibles i m all for single payer everyone puts in and everyone gets covered seems simple to me

0,in the 1960s just before the government got involved in health care the cost of full coverage health insurance would be 20 dollars a month after inflation today 
0,the real question with sanders s plan is whether he s just pandering to his base to fire them up and get them more implicated in his campaign or whether he truly believes in this fantasy that he s trying to sell currently a working universal healthcare system needs much stronger price control mechanisms than the ones outlined so far in his plan  it just so happens that those price control mechanisms are also things that would be wildly unpopular to american voters  even though they d result in a fairer  more efficient overall system in the end is he just leading people on for their own good  this type of cynicism would run contrary to the image of integrity and honesty that he s trying to project so i m not completely sure what to make of this theory

0,gt  debunked this assertion with data showing that fewer than 1 in 10 abortion providers are in majorityblack neighborhoods the black population is largely concentrated into fairly tight areas  and make up less than 12  of the us population it would be interesting to see what percentage of black people as a whole have an abortion clinic in their zip code  zip was what was used in this  study   vs white people  to be a majority black neighborhood there would have to be quite a few black people there since their usage means that black people made up of 50  or more of the neighborhood  it could be 49  black  48  hispanic and they would nt consider it  majority black

0,does anyone know if conservatives  particularly republicans in the south  have some kind of more subtle agenda  s  beneath the veneer of  prolife  and  limited government   attempts to impede women s access to care in 2016 is so absurd that i often wonder if the motivations are deeper than just ignorancesexismracism  religion  and political ideology the ultimate consequences of interfering with women s health rights are so obviously ass backwards and to the detriment of society it makes my head explode  it would nt surprise me if many of these bastard politicians view such actions as a long term investment in their criminal justice systems and keeping their prisons filled  among other sinister motives  do these states  by chance  happen to reap any federal benefits from rampant populations growth  i know many red states get heavy federal subsidies it feels like there s more to it than concern for the  sanctity of life   perhaps i underestimate racism in the south 
0,funny  the only time i have personally heard the claim that planned parenthood was a conspiracysecret genocide of black people was from a professor that focused on black studies and who was herself black i also got to know a student who looked up to said professor as a mentor they both shared some of the most backwards  fuckedup  blmesque stances i have ever seen  this is not a conservative or liberal issue it s a misinformation issue people either make shit up to get what they want or they never bother finding out what s true or false before spouting shit to get what they want all dishonest sides will pull the same trick they want to break you down into groups so you re easier to control you can put any spin on any issue if you do nt care about the truth  here we see someone making an issue black and white while pretending to want to stop the issue from being black and white it is insane we have reached the point we have in politics everyone is contradicting themselves constantly the truth is the last thing they consider  i think the congresswoman made good points  and a gray stance would not bait as many clicks  but she is feeding the fire in her own way it is hypocritical and exhausting to see every day 
0,i love how people can talk about ethnic minorities ignorantly like they do nt fucking understand what a pregnancy is and what it means to take it to term  i remember a few years ago  political camwhore cory booker tried to live on foodstamps to prove that they were really shitty to be on and did nt do a lot for people when half these politicians are forced to work endlessly for shit hours because they do nt have the money to take time off  pay for constant checkups  carry a growing mass on their belly  gain weight  cut out their vices  smoking  drinking   stave off nausea on a regular basis  and then sit on a hospital bed in pain for multiple hours until they re shitting and their asshole tears and a kid comes out  i ll value their opinion on this as much as the opinions of the women who see what their future and what their fetuses  possible futures could look like  they can also adopt all the kids that are brought to term then given away  too just to be consistent surely that s why most of them are in the top 10

0,it has been almost 40 years since the love canal  and this is still happening we need to make some changes to  politics as usual 
0,wow  what he says is so true and spot on  part of me would take it further and start demanding prosecution of the people in power that made or allowed this to happen 
0,send the military and the plumbers in rip that water system apart and replace it i know that will still take a while  but the city is in ruined condition major overhaul required
0,perhaps this is a reminder of what may happen when we expand government to do  everything   little considering that taxpayers do nt have enough money for  everything  i wonder what the city  county  and national governments associated with flint have spent on projects over the last 20 years that were less important than replacing lead pipes that bring water into people s homes  or understanding that the chemistry of drinking water is indeed important when lead pipes are still extant you can try to make this a democrat  republican  liberal  conservative issue  but it s really a demonstration of how government systems can go wrong when the servants of the people lose interest in their service  and the people lose sight of demanding government do basic things before it starts doing political things 
0,2016  0 1 6 
0,and none for kanye either all this money wasting overseas and nothing for our rappers back home 
0,even more infuriating is that the government lets wealthy and well connected criminals get away with things like poisoning the water supply 
0,infinite money for the f35 that will be rendered obsolete by the first dogfighting supersonic drone none for flint 
0,is president bernie going to be perpetually outraged at his own administration when things go wrong 
0,2016 0 1 6 but this a failure on the government of flint  not the free market  from what i ve seen the free market has actually been doing a lot to offset some of horrible conditions there i do nt know how many articles i ve seen of celebrities donating free water to flint for publicity  including bernie himself 
0,this this is what made you think you re obstructionists  
0,  are we the baddies     https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  hn1vxamejru 
0,all any gop politician had to do is remark how they look forward to president obama s nomination to fill this important position and hope and pray he will select a person that s a compromise between their and his views then claim any brought forward are too far to the left of  central  america view over and over until president obama s final year is up  now all you can do is hold you re breath while the rest of america goes blue 
0,oh  so republicans are the victims here   facepalm 
0, nevertheless  tillis put a high bar on what kind of nominee the party should be willing to consider  saying a nominee with an identical resume and capabilities of justice scalia  would be worth a vote 
0,i d rather walk into the senate and find 100 obstructionists  throwing rocks at one another  than 80 old men giving each other handjobs on top of suitcases full of lobbists  money  but i m pretty sure which is more likely 
0, by which i mean to say that we should under no circumstances  appear  to be what we are  but we should definitely not confirm anyone lacking the strongest possible conservative  even theocratic  resume 
0,true 
0,but i thought kashkari was a goldmansachs shill s you can read his full remarks  here   https  wwwminneapolisfedorgnewsandeventspresidentsspeecheslessonsfromthecrisisendingtoobigtofail  gt  i believe we must begin this work now and give serious consideration to a range of options  including the following  breaking up large banks into smaller  less connected  less important entities  turning large banks into public utilities by forcing them to hold so much capital that they virtually can  t fail  with regulation akin to that of a nuclear power plant   taxing leverage throughout the financial system to reduce systemic risks wherever they lie 
0,pretty funny rpolitics is all over kashkari right now  but when he ran as a republican for governor of california back in 2014 he was labeled a shill and considered to be one of the worst men in california 
0,you know sanders campaign is having an effect on this country from top to bottom when headlines like this start popping up try and imagine seeing a headline like this back in 2006  it sounds ridiculous to even think about 
0,oh  so now we re listening to former goldman sachs employees and members of the fed  that s interesting 
0,wanting to place an arbitrary limit on the size of financial institutions is one of the strangest ideas to gain mainstream acceptance in the field of economics  the problem is not that banks are too big  it s that they re too leveraged  given the networking effects involved in finance  having 10 overleveraged small banks may not be any better than having one big overleveraged bank it may actually be easier to regulate and monitor the big one 
0,this is called damage control banks and the fed know reform is coming it s better to control your own fate than let others do it for you 
0,people forget that the federal reserve bank    is not    a government organization it is a privately owned institution it is  the  big bank 
0,he s wrong about  not seeing the next crisis   banks are still selling cdo s and we re due for another housing bubble it wo nt be as bad as the last one due to consumer confidence being low and inhibiting the unbridled optimism that fueled the last one rest assured that we can expect more of the same when the markets correct again
0,there is only one issue i have with what he said and perhaps some on who has a higher degree in economics than i do can explain why i m wrong  i have a minor in economics but does nt increased capital requirements mean banks have much less money to lend thus reducing the amount of money in existence  in economic terms anyway  and thus inflating the value of the dollar  since there is less of it in circulation  causing exports to weaken and imports to strengthen and if my understanding serves one of the problems of the recession was that bank credit simply dried up would nt this idea lead to a similar thing happening  also how small are we talking of making these banks  because economies of scale are still important to keep in mind when redistributing the banking system 
0,this is what they called nationalizing the banks usually we re very clear that we want the government to stay out of our personal finances 
0,he s just pandering nothing to see here
0,someone s feeling the bern
0,he ll either get bribed  assassinated  or threatened and  change  his mind 
0,tl  dw  voter turn out numbers this year were  lower  this year in new hampshire than compared to 2008 because 2008 had a much bigger getoutthevote machine with 8 democratic candidates while 2016 only has 2 candidates in absolute terms  bernie sanders shattered the record with 150k votes  with the previous record holder being hillary with 112k votes conclusion  bernie is turning out voters 
0,bernies revolution has to do with congress and the senate right  thats the main premise of his ability to get his policies enacted  to have a revolution  although im sure the republicans will say its to start a communist revolutionary takeover by playing ads with the soviet national anthem im actually looking forward to what kinds of bullshit they will try and throw at him 
0,boy  that guy sure takes his sweet fucking time getting to the point  does nt he  that s why i do nt listen to talk radio regardless of political leaning 
0,really  because i see news stories about bernie sanders all the time 
0,man  those the media guys sure are jerks why  they even give me a feeling like i m a victim sometimes 
0,i wish people would stop calling it a political revolution it only brings to mind maoist china when you say it like that 
0,and hillary clinton still commands an equal if not greater following  but you wo nt hear that on reddit 
0, gt  complains about censorship  gt  removes all posts mentioning trump and how well he is doing
0,the media wo nt tell me  wow huffington post  washington post  and most the internet are so far up sander s ass hole that they are telling me he shits gold and that they see it for themselves waaaaaaay up there  all i hear about is the bern regardless of if he s great or not  do nt feed me that shit about the media not talking about him  bull fucking shit 
0, the media is cheating me   every politician ever if you believe it  you re an idiot especially in this case the media actually has massive financial incentive to have a close race between sanders and clinton political ads bring tons of money to television stations  radio stations  etc the closer the race  the more money the candidates are going to spend trying to eek out the victory 
0,one weird trick 
0,really because reddit tells me 55 times a day
0,jesus that guy is insanely boring to listen to 
0,no  its not rpolitics is ruining reddit 
0,the internet is included in media and his  revolution  is covered enough but it s nice to be the underdog i suppose 
0,yes the media  the media  always ominous media who somehow always seems to be in cahoots when they do nt report exactly what i want 
0, the revolution will not be televised   http  myoutubecomwatch  v  rgartqrlgy8  gil scott heron
0,in south carolina the revolution is off to a slow start 
0,wow  bernie got the most votes in a state with the population of the city of san antonio tx  and hillary won in a state with 3x the population of new hampshire  impressive  not
0,old white guy talking on a podium does nt get much ratings 
0,federal reservehave fun
0,thanks buzzfeed 
0,and people think the media does nt know what s best for the country 
0,til  revolution  is getting people to vote for you
0,always an oppressed helpless victim  eh 
0,a bunch of loud hipsters jerking off to dreams of socialism and living in norway  isnt a revolution its occupy wallstreet again
0,those who take part know it s happening  the fact that mainstream media does nt report it increases the sense of urgency and help keep the up the spirit while at the same time lull the establishment supporters into a false sense of security so it may actually help 
0,reminds me of the good old ron paul days
0,a revolution without bloodshed is no revolution it s not happening and never will just more buzzwords
0,because sanders freaks are delusional
0,voting is nt a revolution call me when there s barricades on the streets  homeslice 
0,tldw  bernie got more votes than any candidate in the new hampshire primary has ever gotten before 
0,i think the real revolution is towards someone more moderate i ve seen inklings of trump s realization of this i think the candidates have made the mistake of running to the extremes kasich could grab into this trend if he had more charisma  the person in the middle in november will win 
0,we do nt need the media  we have the internet 
0, the revolution will not be televised  how prophetic 
0, remind you of anyone    http  imgurcomgallery7drhiqr 
0,the media is telling us  yall are telling us  everybody knows it stop playing this card 
0,maybe in nevada but overall bernie is polling lower than hillary 
0,you ll need a revolution before it can be televised 
0,actually the bbc was talking about bernie today i m torn between being impressed that they re covering it and being driven up the wall by the awful banality and children s tv tone 
0,except that he has to  you know  win the nomination and then win the election
0,misleading thumbnail is misleading 
0,i hope people will learn that he wants to raise their taxes to a ridiculous level and raid their 401k with his  tax wall street speculation  tax this guy is going to make us all poor 
0,apparently reddit doesnt count as the media
0,what s with this rather 180 rachael seems to be doing  
0,bernie sanders  the bum who wants your money  his family managed to send him to the university of chicago despite a prestigious degree  however  sanders failed to earn a living  even as an adult it took him 40 years to collect his first steady paycheck  and it was a government check   i never had any money my entire life   sanders told vermont public tv in 1985  after settling into his first real job as mayor of burlington  sanders spent most of his life as an angry radical and agitator who never accomplished much of anything and yet now he thinks he deserves the power to run your life and your finances   we will raise taxes   he confirmed monday   yes  we will  http  wwwinvestorscompoliticseditorialsberniesandersthebumwhowantsyourmoney
0,this sounds like it was written by kevin trudeau 
0,nope  not really
0,yeah maaan its the freaking media maaan 
0,this title is hilarious  you re all such blowhards the revolution is upon us  the man just does nt want you to know the man keeping us down
0,fuck off with this circlejerk bullshit  you guys are ruining reddit 
0,we do nt need em bern it down 
0,hahahahahahahahahaha
0,he may have been destined to be a black man in america  but will that end racism  will that end sexism 
0,honestly shame on anyone who made fun of killer mike as an asset this man speaks truth to power better than sanders christ that was a great speech 
0,i think we need to dispel this notion that jeb bush does nt know what he s doing jeb bush okay  yeah  he has no fucking clue what he is doing 
0,try jebbushforpresidentcom lol
0,trump is savage buys the jeb bush website out from under him i hope he keeps the domain and isnt forced to give it back 
0,jeb just wanted a very classy  luxurious makeover for his site just the best the best 
0,also  rjebbush redirects to rthe_donald 
0,i just spat out part of my breakfast not a trump supporter  but that is fucking hilarious 
0,12 months a jeb 
0,jeb  is a foolish guac bowl merchant
0,rjebbush
0,actually  jeb never owned that domain a gay couple in oregon purchased it in 2013 or 14 
0,but but but my momma said i would make a great president 
0,chrome wo nt accept exclamation mark in the url how come 
0,savage donald  i literally own you  trump  ladies and gentlemen 
0,as someone who used to be responsible for a companies website  keeping domains and secure certificates current  you have to be really fucking stupid to let them expire not just because of what happened but you start getting reminders well before it expires  so to let it expire you purposely have to ignore it  or be so incompetent to assign your notifications to a nonmonitored email address you also have the option for automatic renewal if you ca nt be bothered to read your email plus you would think they would have paid for enough time to actually cover the campaign season 
0,troll level  pro
0,did nt this happen once before   
0,i do nt see how the two are related  the donald would buy  every  contenders name if they were available  that makes about as much sense as capitalising a url 
0,gleeful attempts to point out how unsuccessful the jeb bush campaign could well backfire in that this could in itself become an issue and soften opposition to both bush administrations and their respective presidents  best to ignore him rather that rub his face in the dirt 
0,jeb s website is jeb2016com
0,is nt cyber squatting a crime in the usa 
0,where can i stream this  i do nt have msnbc and i love joe and mika
0,ruh roh 
0,trump is just on another level love it 
0,er  does sanders not realize that state budgets in no way reflect federal budgets  state budgets do not cover wars  as that is federal military spending 
0,the matter being discussed is that teachers do not want to pay for the unions political activism  as they do nt want their money supporting the causes the union wants 
0,if the teachers union did a better job  then they would nt have to make the government force people to be members this means they have zero accountability to their members  which leads to the kind of teachers union waste and corruption we have here in chicago 
0,yeah those teacher unions are so great they are just awesome at making education better 
0,so much innuendo so little facts why so coy  if you got something tell us this article is almost meta it s an article about how the writer might go get the sources and facts needed to write an actual article 
0,what a ridiculous piece of agitprop how hard have republicans tried over the years to get one of these laughable scandals to stick  i d at least like to see some originality this time around remember when she was accused of murdering vince foster  then when the obvious lack of evidence became undeniable it simply became another part of the elaborate conspiracy what is more believable  that no plausible reason for indictment exists or hilary is some kind of cartoonish supervillain who acts with impunity and controls the free world from the shadows  if you believe the latter  please also explain why she would want to run for president since she obviously has everything figured out already 
0,man the ny post really has it in for hillary 
0,it s the post never trust the post i do nt even like hillary clinton  but if you guys are at the point where the new york post  a murdoch owned tabloid  is considered a legitimate news source on clinton then there is something seriously wrong with you guys they ve been publishing unsubstantiated hit pieces against her for over 20 years  they are nt exactly unbiased 
0,this rpolitics browbeating is becoming really grating 
0,republicans were saying this about whitewater and cattle futures and travelgate over 20 years ago 
0,berine supporter here just came in to say   ny post  lol 
0,lolor it might just mean that  despite a concerted effort for 30 years to connect her from everything from murder to drug running  these are nt real issues 
0,it  might  also be reasonable to conclude that her not having been indicted is a sign she has nt broken any laws  you know  if you re posting fox news and ny post articles in support of your cause  it might be time to evaluate your course 
0,uhh i have a great idea  let s get ken starr back and give him unlimited power and tons of money to investigate endlessly and if he takes long enough maybe she will get caught having sex with an intern and all the little trolls can say  see i told you so  we always knew she did something  we just had to wait long enough for her to actually do it  gotcha  she s not my first choice for president but if she s so damn good at getting away with all the stuff she s been accused of for 30 years  then maybe she d make a tough and crafty president  in her absence i would nominate the following paragons of virtue  bob livingston  tom delay denny hastert scooter libby newt gingrich irancontra etcetc  yo investigate this  shit happens on both sides of the aisle but since the day bill clinton announced his first run for president  the republicans have redefined the term  witch hunt  if they were half as obsessive about fixing things  we d all be living in the  real  america we all deserve
0,hillary clinton has never broken a law is that the kind of person you want for president 
0,its weird to me that this is pretty high on rall but the comments unanimously think its bullshit 
0,oh my god the republicans used to be the worst when it came to slandering other candidates  but the democrats have now taken the cake 
0,this article is a pure piece of innuendo in which the only source cited by the author are previous writings by the author  and yet hillary haters will inglorious that to spin a tale  just as the author does
0,imagine how much praise rpolitics would be raining upon this woman if bernie was nt running 
0,yawn there have been stories like this promoted by the right wing nut jobs for decades  not years  decades from arkancide to benghazi the republicans have been spouting bullshit lies about hillary forever lies  lies  lies 
0,when bush  cheney  etc  are in jail for war crimes  then we can talk 
0,ny post hit pieces now make it to the front page  ca nt wait for primary mania to be over 
0,have you guys gone so far left that you now find yourselves in the company of the ny post  whats next  everyone in here starts watching fox news 
0,taxpayers spent millions of dollars investigating the clintons and turned up not a whit of truth of the right wing conspiracies 
0,while i of course like the title  we should probably disregard nypost articles 
0,i ca nt pinpoint if but something looks different about herhttp  imgurcomkqgo1jr
0,maybe the author of this article could show an example of a crime worthy of indictment  and why hillary was nt prosecuted for it  seems to me there s ample political will to prosecute the clinton s for any wrongdoing from the right  so if there s sufficient evidence out there  why is nt it being acted upon  just reporting that other people say there s wrongdoing worthy of prosecution is nt  evidence  of anything other than what that person claimed if ken starr has evidence that a crime was committed twenty years ago  what s he been waiting for 
0,you know  if you re posting fox news and generating discussion and opinions based on faulty information 
0,it s so nice having the sense to just sit back and let things play out being defensive is contagious apparently  its so fun watching people clammer over each other to piss the hardest into the wind 
0,nypost doe  boo this man   
0,like that republican nixon not getting indicted 
0,you know  if you re posting fox news and ny post really has it in for hillary 
0,heh i just posted a similar sentiment in another thread before i even read this yes  its opinion but it makes me feel good that im not alone in seeing how hillary is the symbol for so many aspects of our country that are broken its also nice to see that more and more people are beginning to wake up to these concepts hillary is hardpressed to convince voters that she ll fix the very systemic problems that created her 
0,wwwarkancidecom
0,hillary for prison 
0,the clintons scare the fuck out of me house of cards could be about them and not be too much different 
0,all i m saying is if she was nt a rich white woman  and was in fact a poor black young person she would have been shot twice and incarcerated for 2 years pending a trial right now 
0,what if a guy just wants a wank 
0,all you morons going off about how this woman is the devil for doing this is too funny to me you dumbasses do nt even see the point of what this bill represents 
0,its funny i thought this a was a democrat proposing this just goes to show extreme upwards towards authoritarian the wings of the democratrepublican bird go up now
0,why do these lawmakers have the urge to control people s choices 
0,man  i do nt know how many of yall get stuck listening to conservative radio  but why are like half of their ads about ed meds why do so many conservative men have trouble getting it up 
0,judging by her picture  she wo nt have to worry about any man getting a woody she s definitely a twobagger 
0,there is no equivalence between  abortion  and  viagra   this is yet another unserious argument from the regressive left 
0,this woman should be broke  jobless and homeless for this
0,what a fucking twat 
0,the  revolution  is real it s a rejection of globalist neoconservatism  being  policeman of the world   supporting us global hegemony at all costs i have bad news for bernie supporters  the revolution also rejects the agenda of the  globalist left  as well  through overwhelming public support for shutting down illegal immigration and curtailing legal immigration as well for years and years  the globalist left s political strategy has been to import thirdworld voters who support their agenda and do everything in their power to make sure they vote  reject voterid laws  bus people to polls  advocate compulsory voting  and even complain about how nebulous  oppression  causes disenfranchisement rather than pure apathy and lack of agency 
0,i find it troubling how partisan the language in the paper s conclusion is at one point  the authors state that  there is a desperate need for hard  empirical evidence  but then go on to say with what seems to be a high degree of confidence that white americans have a growing influence in the political process whereas racial minorities are finding it harder to vote  the fact that this paper is such an outlier when compared to similar studies on the relation between voter id requirements and turnout is concerning when paired with the rhetoric used by the authors of this paper 
0,they grow up so fast

0,as someone who used to be responsible for a companies website  keeping domains and secure certificates current  you have to be really fucking stupid to let them expire not just because of what happened but you start getting reminders well before it expires  so to let it expire you purposely have to ignore it  or be so incompetent to assign your notifications to a nonmonitored email address you also have the option for automatic renewal if you ca nt be bothered to read your email plus you would think they would have paid for enough time to actually cover the campaign season

0,the hillary campaign is about hillary becoming president like she deserves it or something like us electing her is just completing some prophecy that hillary has waited her whole life to fulfill she reminds me of frank underwood in house of cards  the sanders campaign is not about giving sanders something  its about sanders giving the country something he doesnt act like we owe him something  he acts like we owe ourselves something

0,did anyone else cringe a little bit when hillary named mandela as the foreign leader who would influence her foreign policy then hamhandedly segwayed into how she thinks bernie disrespects obama  it seemed like such a pander to the  mostly black  audience in south carolina that cost her the nomination there in 2008  i was happy that bernie forcefully defended himself there and told her he s supported obama throughout his term but  as a us senator  had a duty to the people to question the president in certain issues that s bernie s commitment to democracy over politics  something hillary does nt get

0,nothing is more powerful than an idea whose time has come  this killed hillarys campaign in 2008 as democrats were euphoric over electing the first black president  and undecided  independent voters were leery of the clinton brand and the negatives that come with it  its 2016 wall street greed sucker punched the world to its knees in 2008 young voters are looking at a  still  broken health care system  staggering college loan debt  skyrocketing housing costs  stagnant wages in a time of record corporate profits and trillion dollar cash hoards  and hillary clinton  while repeatedly cashing enormous speaking engagement checks and donations from wall street and big healthcare  pharma  keeps attempting to tell voters that she is the change agent that will fix wall street and healthcare  bernie sanders is like a genie that popped out of the bottle at exactly the right moment in time  who appeals to all the voters put off by clinton for reasons i just mentioned

0,back when hillary ran against obama  i remember thinking that she would make a better president than obama  but that she could never win a general election i do nt remember disliking her  even when she went a bit negative  this year it s a bit different i still believe she is absolutely incapable of winning a general election the republicans just hate her too much the base will come out to vote against her  even if they wo nt come out to support trump or cruz or whatever empty suit they nominate  but this year  i m finding myself really disliking clinton on so many counts  her platform simply wo nt solve our problems her motives are clearly all about hillary her rhetoric is so crafted to mislead she s attacking a guy who has refused to attack her back  hillary is pretending to steal bernie s issues  without having the decency to actually do so she offers weaker versions of his plans  but claims they are stronger and she uses cheap rhetorical tricks to obfuscate the differences between her plans and bernies it s not a battle of ideas for her it s just manipulation and taking advantage of the confusion she s deliberately causing  she s clearly taken too much money from too many special interests to ever be impartial  let alone tough on their industries  worst of all is her condescending tone when speaking to young people she refuses to acknowledge their problems  and does nt seem at all interested in actually courting them she does nt think their votes matter she s sure they ll stay home i would nt mind all this if her actual platform and agenda was going to improve their lives but it wo nt  because has no understanding of their problems  i just ca nt vote for hillary i just ca nt she s a bad  bad candidate she will be a terrible president  i might get out and vote against donald trump getting the nuclear codes  if it comes to that but i m praying bernie pulls off the upset

0,from the article   richard hasen  professor of law and political science at uc irvine school of law  cautioned against drawing conclusions from the paper  which is an outlier  the authors of the paper also collected no actual data  they just developed a statistical  model  that outputs the desired conclusion  voter id is rayciss   the article itself  is not even published in a peerreviewed journal   http  pagesucsdedu  zhajnalpage5documentsvoteridhajnaletalpdf   meaning it s just more politically motivated academic garbage you can take with a grain of salt

0,every other industrialized country and even third world countries require id to vote 
0,how hard is it to get an id 
0,i do nt know about this  honestly  i do nt really think the voter id thing should be a big deal  but there is literally no excuse to not have an id  just no valid excuse  i grew up in severe poverty to a single mother that worked multiple jobs and she still managed to get an id and so did i  you not getting an id is absolutely your own fault  so that is nt really a valid excuse 
0,the big difference here is that one group is using odd year cycles in which voter participation is low to gain an advantage while the other group is limiting voter participation in all elections  in the first case  there s nothing that prevents the electorate from participating in full other than their own apathy in the second  there is a barrier to full participation  there s a distinct difference between using the rules to your advantage and changing the rules to your advantage  edit  the only  legitimate  problem that is solved by voter id laws is voter impersonation one person casting a vote as another  while ostensibly also casting their own vote  there have been fewer than 31 incidents of this type for over 1 billion votes cast   https  wwwwashingtonpostcomnewswonkwp20140806acomprehensiveinvestigationofvoterimpersonationfinds31credibleincidentsoutofonebillionballotscast  so this is a problem that has a 0000000031  impact on our elections but denies the vote to hundreds of thousands of americans

0,if voting requires an id and you have to pay for that id how is that not a violation of the 24th amendment 
0,there was a fun little experiment done a couple years ago that showed that if you re a state legislator who supports voter id  you ve probably got racial biases in how you respond to your constituents  http  papersssrncomsol3paperscfm  abstract_id  2422596 basically  they sent out identical letters half signed with an anglo sounding name  half with a latino sounding name among legislators that supported voter id  the anglo sounding names were responded to over twice as often as the latino names there was little discrepancy with legislators that did not support voter id laws 
0,if you are an adult and do nt have an id  i m going to assume you re not a very productive member of society  democrats are just angry that voter id hinders their give people a bunch of free shit and bus them to polling stations strategy 
0,that s the point 
0,wrote my college thesis on this issue via a case study of indiana vs massachusetts  2014   voter id laws particularly affected hundreds of thousands of hispanics  african americans  women  and elderly wouldbe voters voter id laws also resulted in less than 20 voter fraud convictions takeaway  voter id laws disenfranchise certain groups at an astronomically larger volume than said laws combat voter fraud 
0,why are people trying to remove voter id laws instead of removing the limitations on poor people to get their id s  if you lock yourself out of your car you do nt decide to remove all the locks you keep a spare key somewhere

0,so organize and get people registered and out to vote they did it in the 1960 s why can not it be done now 
0,i understand both arguments being made in this thread i think a politically easy solution to solve all of this would be to create an automatic voter registration where every individual can have a voter id shipped to their house when they are 17  to participate in primary if they are 18 by election day   does anyone know how much a federal program like this would cost 
0,why does rpolitics suck europe s dick when it comes to healthcare and taxes but completely ignore the average european reaction to learning that the usa does nt require id to vote

0,it s not in the constitution anywhere that says americans are free from having to have documents i think people are imposing liberties that never existed  i think the far left often uses this tactic to fool people in the middle  i do nt see it as unreasonable to actually enforce the law when determining who s running the country i do nt understand why i m supposed to let voter fraud be even a possibility instead  people will claim things like racism  rightwing conspiracy  or something else that convinces me the moderates are being tricked

0,gt  clinton leads sanders 50 percent to 40 percent heading into south carolina  whose democratic voting electorate is more racially diverse than either iowa or new hampshire  sanders holds a narrow 3point advantage over clinton  47 percent to 44 percent  among white voters  gt  while sanders has drawn a significant portion of his support from the youngest voting bloc  under the age of 30   just 25 percent of millennial black voters said they are supporting the vermont senator  compared with 64 percent who said they are backing clinton the reverse is true among white millennials  who support sanders 75 percent to 22 percent  gt  the poll was conducted online from feb 814  surveying 11417 registered voters nationwide the survey s overall margin of error is plus or minus 11 percentage points  this  graph   http  media2snbcnewscomjnewscms2016_071418976nbcsurveymonkey_weekly_election_tracking_poll_clinton_sanders_chartbuilder_adabea7e779bf0fd083d1d5d52364cffnbcnewsux28801000png  that i found  here   http  wwwnbcnewscompolitics2016electionclintonmaintainsnationalleadoversandersafternhlossn519076  shows the national poll  s and sanders slowly  but steadily climbing it also shows hillary s decline on a somewhat sharper slant  due to her own campaign implosions 
0,this is the 2nd national poll since nh that real clear politics refuses to put up 
0,ah yes  the daily  sanders is closing the gap  post 
0,i m glad he s closing the gap  but i would of thought the gap should be smaller given all the scandals surrounding clinton 
0,this is confirmed by  this graph   http  pollingreuterscom  polltr131  of a very informative running poll he s closing the gap among  blacks   http  pollingreuterscom  polltr131filterssc_race  2  very quickly too  a 2540  change over one month  one troubling conclusion from this particular data set for the sanders campaign is that he is gaining almost all of his support from previous nonvoters rather than from converted hillary supporters  particularly in the general population   the early registration deadlines in many states will prevent a large chunk of sanders  momentum from translating to actual votes  since his new supporters will be unable to register up to a month before the primary  for example  in texas  previously unregistered voters activated by his results in iowa  new hampshire and the considerable media attention he s received since then will not be able to vote for him the cumulative effect of this over all states might decide the entire primary election 
0,interesting piece of data from this poll  gt  while sanders has drawn a significant portion of his support from the youngest voting bloc  under the age of 30   just 25 percent of millennial black voters said they are supporting the vermont senator  compared with 64 percent who said they are backing clinton the reverse is true among white millennials  who support sanders 75 percent to 22 percent  this does nt really conform with the media narrative i wonder if there are other polls with similar results 
0,i m sure this has been posted before but has anyone seen this  a bunch of really conservative people have posted this on facebook today and i m worried it is going to hurt bernie in the polls if anyone reads this is there any truth to it  also i m voting for bernie regardless but i just wanted to hear what others had to say  http  wwwthegatewaypunditcom201602berniesandersabumwhodidntearnhisfirstpaycheckuntilage40  mtcid  cf

0,bernie sanders and the whitehouse  if you think the two do nt go together  you re not alone but you re also wrong  not that he would hold that against you because sanders  with apologies to the democrats  barack obama  is perhaps the nicest and most sincere man in politics and has been for 40 years  walk through congress with sanders before the gates open and you ll see him greet the security guards and ushers by name sit near the podium during fillibusters and you ll hear him call out to the lobbyists watch him afterward and you ll find him standing patiently by his locker  respectfully answering the lamest questions from reporters representing the smallest hometown newspapers  that was nt something you would see with hillary clinton  clinton would question your parentage  sanders will ask about your kids  then listen intently to the answer  when the supreme court held a memorial service for justice scalia  sanders flew to texas to see his family  then flew right back to take part in the service never mind that it was his only day off in a month  it s just respect   sanders said  yet a politician who shows respect to everyone does nt always see it in return  clearly sanders lacks the glitz and glamour  the flamboyance and the egotism to stand out in a tabloid world which is why he s thought of primarily as a nice guy and not a great politician  truth is  he s both  he s also crew cuts and blue collars he s middle america  right down to the  please  and  thank you  in his world  guns are for hunting  not for carrying into night clubs  no wonder the license plate on his pickup truck  what else would he drive   once read dbth  shorthand for do nt believe the hype  but you can believe the numbers  which make a strong case that sanders should be the president  in this case  a nice guy should finish first 
0,how many articles do we have to post about him closing the gap  how about posting an article when he closes it 
0,no he s not he s not even close conservative news outlets said the same thing about romney in 2012 just to give false hope even going as far as saying he won the election stop posting sensationalized headlines from misleading sources  edit  the people down voting me because i m stating facts are just as bad as the audience at the last republican debate who booed the moderators for stating facts

0,the aca is better than what we had before  but it s still far from a good system millions of people still have no access to health care because they ca nt afford the insurance premiums even people with decent insurance are going bankrupt because of deductibles  copays and expensive premiums the insurance industry does nt give a shit about our health it s time to get rid of the health insurance industry it should not exist it is just a parasite

0,it a better wold  all insurance would cover is unforeseeable  catastrophic costs the fact that you need insurance to pay for things that you know you are going to need  checkups  defeats the whole point of insurance 
0,insurance is supposed to only cover catastrophic costs  it s not supposed to cover your  20 subscriptions that s not what insurance is  that s one reason why prices are so high  imagine if your car insurance company had to pay for oil changesfluidsinspectionsetc the price would rise dramitically
0,currently in nc the only health insurance provider  blue cross and blue shield  for about 1015 eastern counties is going to cease to do business there  so people with preexisting conditions who were finally able to get insurance due to the aca are now being told they will have no coverage within their own county so their only recourse is to travel hours away from their own towns and buy insurance  then whenever they get sick to drive those same hours to see a doctor at all the aca was great for a lot of reasons but it is still very lacking and we need to move forward on true universal health care  not universal health insurance 
0,insurance is expensive 
0,well we could take down the healthcare monopolies and then allow for capitalism to way down the cost allowing for healthcare providers to compete statewide would help these two would see a cost reduction and open up insurance to people who may not be able to afford it now i does nt have to be universal health care to work  it just ca nt have the monopolies they have now 
0,it only serves to help feeding the doctors who get artificial monopoly with government controlled supply if you want more coverage  allow more medical schools and students instead of subsidizing their monopoly i guess aipac has it under total control with this liberal narrative though
0,if medicaid expansion had been mandatory as in the original law  i think obamacare would be doing a much better job  however complying with the regulations made the private insurance market pretty brutal as far as sticker shock goes the new normal is a highdeductible plan  which incurs a lot more out of pocket lump payouts trying to meet that deductible if you  have health insurance  with a  3000 deductible  you can still easily go bankrupt when that bill hits  if not immediately then somewhere along the journey to your  10000 out of pocket maximum for the year  i have a middleclass job but the only way i could pay for the outofpocket expenses to treat my wife s cancer was borrowing from my 401k  most people are nt so lucky  situations like this are just so unfuckingnecessary that it s incredibly frustrating if america ca nt figure out affordable universal healthcare like every other wealthy country  then america is nt that freaking great 
0,yeah my deductible for going to the er is insanely high so high i could nt pay it anyway so no insurance is the real life reality

0, sanderscare would take employer coverage away from tens of millions of satisfied customers  destroy the health insurance business  good 
0,the real question with sanders s plan is whether he s just pandering to his base to fire them up and get them more implicated in his campaign or whether he truly believes in this fantasy that he s trying to sell currently a working universal healthcare system needs much stronger price control mechanisms than the ones outlined so far in his plan  it just so happens that those price control mechanisms are also things that would be wildly unpopular to american voters  even though they d result in a fairer  more efficient overall system in the end is he just leading people on for their own good  this type of cynicism would run contrary to the image of integrity and honesty that he s trying to project so i m not completely sure what to make of this theory

0,disclaimer  i think obama should nominate someone  and the senate should hold confirmation hearings but this article does not accurately describe most republicans  statements on this issue  the vast majority of republican statements  although  notably  not the cruz one cited in the article  carefully phrase the issue as whether a nominee has been  nominated and confirmed  in the president s last year in office  although kennedy was confirmed in 1988  he was nominated by reagan at the end of 1987  so he does nt fall under this definition

0,since when does the secretary of state has to deal with breaking banks or not 
0,so we ve moved on to supposition articles now 
0,if he had clinton s resume and was nt trying to dismantle the banking system  absolutely it s not like she was the only person they paid to speak they had an entire speaker series featuring successful people from diverse backgrounds 
0,secretary of state is foreign policy  she was nt the damn secretary of treasury  holy hell the misinformation and bad thought processes
0,the secretary of state is being taken to task for notbreaking up domestic banks  this is officially the dumbest anticlinton thing on rpolitics this week 
0,absolutely you are out of your minds if you think bankers are nt going to want to hear the outgoing treasury secretary speak 
0,i am fairly certain that if bernie sanders had been treasury secretary  that he would have been courted for speeches to banking events no matter what type of policy he had 
0,if goldman sachs is run by  say  surly junior high kids or ted cruz  yeah  i would nt pay to hear from enemies  if  however  i wanted to get a perspective of someone who did  indeed  regulate my business and lower my profit margin  i would want hear from them i would want to know their unvarnished perspective as the winner  in order to alter my strategy this is because i m a grownup  this does nt have anything to do with hilary  just that the premise of the title assumes that fifth graders run the world which  granted  may be true 
0,no  a bank would nt want someone who s actively trying to stop them from profiting so handsomely speaking at their institution  because you know exactly what a bernie speech to goldman sachs would sound like 
0,this speaking program is not some big secret you can go  look at their website   http  wwwgoldmansachscomourthinkingtalksatgs  for lots of information the point  according to one redditor who worked at a big bank  is simply  getting famous people to draw potential clients   https  npredditcomrpoliticscomments45xcbkwhile_clinton_and_many_on_the_left_decryd00xb90  context  3   the speakers are famous people of all stripes  prominent athletes  scientists  retired military  entrepreneurs  russel simmons  dean kamen   the archbishop of canterbury  etc  there are some leftyoutsider people too such as amory lovins and linda hirshman  but in general not that many are politicians because not that famous 
0,not a fan of hilary and do nt believe she has any desire to be super tough against big moneycorporationsbanks or whatever  but her job as secretary of state had nothing to do with the economy 
0,gt  if this sounds strange  let s imagine a slightly different scenario suppose bernie sanders had spent four years in president obama s cabinet during which time he did everything he could to try to break up the big banks and have corporate criminals put behind bars does anyone believe goldman sachs would pay him  250000 to recount his experiences  yes 
0,yes hillary clinton completely failed in her capacity as secretary of the treasury jesus fucking christ guys  quit shoving this shit down my throat 
0,why do we need to break up the big banks  it s not like tesla and apple and amazon and all the big companies can bank at the neighborhood credit union if we orderly capital markets and a strong economy we have to have the big banks 
0,ridiculous and obtuse argument but does nt matter because fuck hillary      _    _  
0,so she was an awful sos because she did nt break up big banks 
0,this article is just the consistent  hillary takes money from big banks  argument  only reworded poorly and framed in a way that makes no sense
0,secretary of state has nothing to do with domestic financial institutions people in this thread are so dumb 
0,yes  well maybe not 250k since he wasnt first lady as well  but there would probably be a big interest in getting him as speaker too
0,why would you think bernie would do that  there s a huge difference between what a politician with no real power will say versus what one will actually do once he is in power 
0,you people are the worst get past her speaking circuit money talk about a more interesting nonissue like her terrible yellow coat 
0,gt  it s not just that the politician wants to act to curry the favor of the rich and powerful  more typically they identify with the interests of the rich and powerful so that they do nt even see themselves as compromising a principle  gt  when we actually see money being handed over to politicians from the wealthy  whether in the form of large speaking fees or a highpaying job  it is probably best to think of it as analogous to a valentine present no one loves their spouse or significant other because of a generous valentine gift  rather it is a symbol of ongoing affection 
0,self posts not allowed oh wait unless it s from a corporate entity it is
0,yes  they just want to throw money around for the fun of it have you not watch the wolf of wall street 
0,not the best analogy being in the cabinet does nt mean you just get to do whatever you want you d probably have to stay in your lane  how about   bernie sanders spent his 30year political career not just talking about income inequality and the necessity of government regulation on big banks  but acting on it does anyone believe goldman sachs would pay him  250000 to recount his experiences  
0,gt  suppose bernie sanders had spent four years in obama s cabinet and tried to break up the big banks does anyone believe goldman sachs would pay him  250000 to recount his experiences  except hillary did nt say that by all accounts given so far  it was more a rahrah speech than it was her telling goldman of her accounts of trying to break up the big banks so this entire statement is based on a false supposition 
0,i find it funny how almost every comment here is making fun of the stupidity of this post and article yet the article has 4000 points  87  liked  and is sitting at the top of reddit 
0,we ran out of everything else and now we re down to making up shit entirely eh 
0,the top comments in this thread are all people who only read the quote and not the entire article smh
0,wtf what a stupid argument clinton was sec state  not the sec treasury or head of any regulatory agency so she would nt be doing anything to threaten banks they likley had her speak bc she s a clinton  been around and former sec state  even if she was a regulator  it would nt surprise me if she would speak at a banking event  and any  breaking up of banks  would be bc congress came up with a law with regs requiring them to divest themselves of certain busiensses  ie reinstating glass  steagall provisions 
0,are you kidding  of course they would  why do you think it s the toughest most vicious prosecutorsregulators get hired by the banks  not only do poachers make the best gamekeepers  but it also takes them out of the equation if gs offered bernie a million to do some work for them it would make it much harder for him to come down on them later 
0,hillary is a status quo presidential candidate  if she gets the nomination and the job things will remain mostly as they are with little attempt to change them  the big banks know this 
0,just another way of saying what bernie said in the last debate   i m paraphrasing   i guess these banks just love to throw away money  right   it s obvious to anyone who will think about it  but plenty of people are invested in not thinking about it 
0,know thine enemy so yes they would he would most likely refuse it regardless if he was retired or not 
0,you mean  650k
0,i thing goldman sachs is double playing you all 250k is absolutely nothing to them but it is enough to appear to support hillary without really helping her this obviously actually hurts her and helps sanders  the one they really want in office because they can us him to suck the blood out of our economy and send us into depression  where sachs will profit massively 
0,exactly this  if i do not explicitly see it  it does nt exist  mantra is ridiculously short sighted i ve said the same thing before  probably on here   the politicians that do literally change their vote for cash  seem to be the ones that get caught the goal of the money is to bring these people into the same social strata as those with the money make them part of the club the more they hang out  the more washed over with those ideals they will be dishonesty is not a simple process

0,sanders supporters  one problem is that some of us ca nt get on board with the evil wall street stuff it s very difficult legally to say exactly why and how you re going to prosecute bankers for what happened in 2008 it s very difficult to craft regulations to correct exactly the things we want without having either very bad unintended consequences  or loopholes that render them useless i see it as a problem we have as a country  and something we really need to think about and be smart about bernie actually kinda scares me with his us vs them stuff  if you have the time  take a look at  this video   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  qclmwlgcgg0  of a slightly boring economist who s studied the problem extensively to me this is kind of talk and approach we need if we really want to solve the problem sure  it s not a rousing as bernie s power to the people  stuff  but there you go let the republicans have their demagogues  someone needs to be the smart party 
0,i think it would be money well spent they can learn about his mindset and how to take evasive action for next time 
0,if he actually tried to break up the banks  getting a detailed debriefing of what worked  did nt work  and his thoughts on the matter   250k would be a bargain  think about it if you ran a company with billions in profit  and you spent millions on lobbying  paying think tanks  and other expensive tactics to prevent legislation and regulatory action against it spending  250k to find out from the other side what is actually working and not working would worth every penny 
0,does no one here remember anything that happened back when the clintons were still in arkansas  anyone that wants this person to be the leader of the   free world   has either had their head in the sand for the past 40 years  does nt pay attention to the history of this family  does nt care  or is probably under the age of 25

0,if i were a wall street wolf  i would pay 250k for them to tell me how they tried to stop me  so i could learn more about how to defend my stake  and also because 250k is chump change

0,fuckin hell  you all are embarrassing the bernie cult has to be comprised of nothing but college freshmen there s no other explanation rpolitics get your shit together  you fuckin idiots 
0,i dont like trump and i would nt vote for him but i do kind of see why people would vote for him he does nt let people push him around  he kicked out that one blm protester for example and i i dont know if any other candidate would do that i guess he speaks to a lot of peoples frustrations 
0,say what you will about him but i think we all need to recognize a champion of the people and a senator who is attempting to make our democracy work for the people he represents 
0,has bernie sanders ever run a business  is he aware that in some businesses  the government gets 80 cents to the dollar  that s outrageous 
0,so it s a couple of links deep in this article  but if you go into the american gaming association s voter information papers that they actually distributed to gaming workers  they gave trump a yellow  green is considered progaming  red was antigaming  the man currently owns a las vegas hotel and casino and they gave him the same gaming rating as bernie sanders and the only reason they gave sanders a yellow is because  information not available  what an absolute sham the trump name literally is a part of the vegas skyline and this organization is trying to make trump out to be wishywashy on gaming 
0,i love arguing politics with coworkers
0,gt  the group s voter guide would probably pass muster in the precitizens united days  says larry noble  a lawyer for campaign legal center and former general counsel for the federal election commission  so the article is saying that  citizens united  has very little to do with this ability to essentially endorse candidates  before  citizens united   there was nothing wrong with a corporation saying  hillary clinton hates puppies   because the law drew a line at  hillary clinton hates puppies and you should nt vote for her  i m not really sure that makes a huge difference 
0,i ve found it s best to not discuss politics at work  mostly because i m pretty well informed and most people that want to talk politics are nt or worse  they re willfully ignorant 
0,that  casino voter guide   http  bigassetshuffingtonpostcomnvcasinovoterguidepdf  is pure garbage here are some highlights   hillary is designated  opensupportive  of gaming  apparently for paying some recent  lukewarm lip service to casino moguls this is despite her opposition to casinos when she was first lady of arkansas  which is mentioned first in the guide    ben carson is designated  opensupportive   and ted cruz is designated  mixed   but they have the same views  that it s up to individual states whether to allow gambling   cruz apparently loses points for saying the government should nt subsidize casino owners   bernie sanders is designated  mixed   citing  no information available  i suppose they could nt be bothered to make a fiveminute phone call to his campaign before printing up these brochures   donald trump is designated as  mixed   apparently because his atlantic city casinos went bust  along with the rest of ac s local economy   it s mentioned that trump currently operates a hotel on the vegas strip  but no bonus points appear to have been awarded for this 
0,keep just these recent decisions in mind where justice scalia was a part of the 54 majority that could have different outcomes if he is replaced by a democrat president   in a 54 majority limits in mccutcheon v fec  the court invalidated the aggregate contribution limits that were first put in place by the federal election campaign act of 1971   in atamp  t mobility v concepcion  the 54 majority ruled that corporations can effectively mandate arbitration agreements that preclude consumers from bringing class actions to combat fraud and enforce their rights without access to an impartial judge and jury  and without the resources to go it alone in arbitration  people typically abandon their claims and corporate wrongdoers are never held accountable many states enacted consumer protection laws to curtail the pernicious practice of forced arbitration  but in concepcion the supreme court held that such laws are preempted by an old federal statute from 1925 called the federal arbitration act  faa    the 54 majority in michigan v epa overturned epa regulations safeguarding communities from toxic pollution by power plants that causes up to 11000 premature deaths each year essentially  the court  s decision places a premium on businesses  bottom lines over public health and limits the epa  s ability to regulate hazardous air pollutants over the objections of corporate interests   in ledbetter v goodyear tire and rubber co  the 54 court majority made it virtually impossible to bring a claim of longrunning sex or race discrimination in pay under title vii of the 1964 civil rights act  a decision later reversed by a congressional statute a woman had been paid less than her male peers for 20 years and the court stated she had no right to bring a lawsuit for equal pay because she failed to file suit within 180 days of the first discrimination  even though she had no way of learning about the discrimination until years later   in davis v fec  a 54 majority overturned the  millionaire  s amendment   congress  s effort to level the playing field in the political process and reduce the influence of wealth on elections by increasing the contribution limits to candidates facing selffunded opponents   in florence v board of chosen freeholders  the 54 court majority ruled that local officials can stripsearch anyone accused of any crime  even if there is no reason to suspect contraband or concealed weapons  and can not be sued for invasion of privacy   the 54 majority in shelby county v holder overturned a key section of the 1965 voting rights act  making it much harder to protect against discrimination in voting not only did the majority dismissively reject tens of thousands of pages of congressional findings supporting the coverage formula contained in section 4 of the nearlyunanimous 2006 reauthorization of the vra  but the opinion was noted for failing to provide any legal or constitutional rationale for its holding nothing in the text of the constitution was cited to justify the court  s novel decision to strike down the cornerstone of american civil rights law   the 54 majority in leegin creative leather products inc v psks inc overruled a 96yearold rule that had made vertical price fixing per se illegal under federal antitrust law overturning the almost century of antitrust law  the court decided that manufacturers and retailers could sometimes engage in pricefixing in dissent  justice breyer cited studies estimating that this change in law would cost consumers  300 billion a year in increased prices on everyday items   a 53 majority  since justice sotomayor recused herself  in american express co v italian colors restaurant ruled that a smallbusiness owner could not bring an antitrust lawsuit challenging a large corporation  s alleged abuse of its monopoly power  even though  it was claimed  it was that very monopoly power that allowed the corporation to force an agreement to arbitrate and not litigate all complaints against it the court upheld the use of forced arbitration clauses even if it made enforcing federal laws like the sherman act practically impossible in dissent  justice kagan explained that the court  s decision allows   t  he monopolist    to use its monopoly power to insist on a contract effectively depriving its victims of all legal recourse   the 54 majority in burwell v hobby lobby stores  inc decided that forprofit corporations can claim religious rights and can exempt themselves from federal laws requiring them to provide contraceptive coverage to employees the majority also rewrote the religious freedom restoration act  with potentially dangerous consequences for lgbt and other americans   in parents involved in community schools v seattle school district  the 54 court majority prohibited school districts from attempting voluntarily to promote school desegregation through student reassignment plans   in walmart v dukes  approximately one million female walmart employees tried to file a classaction lawsuit over claims of sex bias the 54 decision by the court made it nearly impossible for a class of workers to use for widespread corporate misbehavior that comes in the form of unwritten policies essentially  every worker has to bring their own individual claim  making walmart and other large companies realistically judgment proof to these types of claim   in two 54 decisions  solid waste agency of northern cook county v us army corps of engineers and rapanos v united states  the court effectively took many waterways outside the protection of the clean water act  even though pollution from these waterways can dirty the drinking water of 117 million americans as a result of the court  s decision  1500 major pollution investigations have been halted  and epa actions against water polluters have fallen by 50    in national federation of independent business v sebelius which upheld the patient protection and affordable care act under the taxing power of congress  a 54 majority on the court overturned 70 years of precedent dealing with the commerce clause prior to this case  the court had held that congress has the authority to regulate activities that have a substantial effect on interstate commerce in the area of economic activities   substantial effect  can be found based on the cumulative impact of the activity across the country for example  the supreme court held that congress could use its commerce clause authority to prohibit individuals from cultivating and possessing small amounts of marijuana for personal medicinal use because marijuana is bought and sold in interstate commerce the relationship between health care coverage and the national economy is even stronger and more readily apparent the court had also said that congress could use its commerce power to forbid hotels and restaurants from discriminating based on race  even though their conduct was refusing to engage in commercial activity under an unbroken line of precedents stretching back 70 years  congress has the power to regulate activities that  taken cumulatively  have a substantial effect on interstate commerce people not purchasing health insurance unquestionably has this effect this ruling  if a liberal justice is replaced with someone like scalia  could overturn vast amounts of social programs like medicare and worker protections  on the other hand  occasionally a justice like justice kennedy has sided with the liberal justices to produce 54 decisions that would be in danger if a republican wins the white house and a liberal justice dies or retires while they are in office   in obergefell v hodges  a 54 court majority ruled that the constitution protects the right of samesex couples to marry   a 54 majority in texas department of housing and community affairs v the inclusive communities project upheld the longstanding interpretation of the federal fair housing act to prohibit practices with unjustified discriminatory impact   in massachusetts v epa  a 54 court majority upheld the authority of the epa to regulate greenhouse gases   a 54 majority upheld voterpassed nonpartisan redistricting reform in arizona state legislature v arizona independent redistricting commission   in williamsyulee v the florida bar  a 54 majority upheld a ban on state judicial candidates directly soliciting campaign funds   in boumediene v bush  a 54 majority ruled that prisoners detained in guantanamo can file habeas corpus petitions to challenge their detention   a 54 majority in alabama democratic conference v alabama invalidated a state redistricting scheme that used race to harm minority voters   a 54 majority ruled in favor of workers  rights in csx transportation v mcbride ruling railroads are liable for workers  injuries under federal statute if the railroad was partially responsible for the injury through its negligence

0,thanks scotus  scalia was bound and determined to interpret  and not create  the law  which in my opinion is shortsighted we need justices that interpret the law but above all protect the democracy 
0,once we rub out the first amendment of the constitution and replace it with the 28th  we will be able to pass laws which prohibit political speech in the workplace

0, in truth  our affluent  establishment democrats can no more be budged from their core dogmas  that education is the solution to all problems  that professionals deserve to lead  that the downfall of the working class is the inevitable price we pay for globalization  than creationists can be wooed away from the tenets of  intelligent design  
0,not bad for theguardian i like the last bit about the dogma of the left   education is the solution to all problems   not when preaching the wrong thing  edit  which was what the article was getting at  il admit i spedread
0,this  and another article  really describe to me the difference between clintonera thought and sanders thought clinton economics is to have unfettered capitalist coupled with biggovernment welfare in the form of transfer payments to those harmed by capitalism sanders favors a more fair form of capitalism that is restrained  designed to not allow people to become billionaires instead of transfer payments funded by taxes  he would rather see more opportunities with their cost baked into the pricing of goods and services  i prefer the sanders approach because it is tenable everyone hates high taxes to fund welfare payments it is better to put more people to work with an economy that is designed to do this rather than one designed to make a few people insanely rich 
0,if the democrats were against inequality  they would nt have given the shareholders of major financial corporations billions of dollars in free money over the past 8 years 
0,gt  that the downfall of the working class is the inevitable price we pay for globalization this is clinton s ethos so sorry  working class  but your suffering and futility is the price so that we can have our multinationals and cheap consumer shit but we all know  the elite are the real victims of globalization they get to see their fellow citizens suffer and die and it s the elite that has to deal with that burden 
0,so if republican establishment serves the 1  and democrat establishment serves the 10   1  inclusive   that leaves the 90  without any representation sounds like a cause for revolution to me it s just a republicrat money grab and some of you have been fooled to think it s different

0,the dnc is in a tight spot they ve put a lot of time  money  and effort into clinton  and are now increasingly willing to send good money after bad if they think that there s still a chance that they can pull clinton out of her nosedive to get her the nomination  they can similarly delude themselves into thinking that  by the general  the email thing will have blown over  especially if clinton herself has not been candid with the democratic leadership about what was on that system because  she  believes that they will have no choice but to back her if she can get the nomination  do nt operate under the assumption that just because the dnc establishment wants hillary as the nominee and hillary wants the support of the dnc that either trusts the other  honestly  one of the more damning things for clinton was the house gop taking a step back and just saying   you know what  we think the fbi s got this covered

0,they offer the same variation of the time tested outsider vs insider rhetoric that got every president elected since the early 90s  in 2008  it was hillary the beltway insider vs obama the political outsider  in 2000  george bush was the real american  down to earth folk that gets hardworking citizens  in 1992  bill clinton was the american dream he pulled himself from poverty up to the hallowed halls  and earned his way into yale law  now in 2016  we have two candidates who tapped into that same vein and using that rhetoric to get into power it is empty promises and platitudes that amount to nothing when they have to deal with people who disagree with them on a fundamental level

0,please  please  i beseech you all  stop with the vp talk it will not happen and should not happen warren far more valuable and powerful in the senate 
0,how  take a look at every other developed countries for example in my country  france  id are free  every small city hall can generate them  employers ca nt refuse their employees to take a day off  paid   to go to their city hall every citizen has one if tomorrow politicians tried to stop the need of a id to vote we would have a new civil war 
0,i find it troubling how partisan the language in the paper s conclusion is at one point  the authors state that  there is a desperate need for hard  empirical evidence  but then go on to say with what seems to be a high degree of confidence that white americans have a growing influence in the political process whereas racial minorities are finding it harder to vote  the fact that this paper is such an outlier when compared to similar studies on the relation between voter id requirements and turnout is concerning when paired with the rhetoric used by the authors of this paper 
0,if he would pick her for vp i d lose it that s the dream team 
0,how the hell is asking for an id a bad thing  this will always confuse me you need an id for pretty much everything 
0,is there a nonyt source of this video  i m at work right now and yt is blocked 
0,protester used  stump the trump  it had no effect 
0,sanders straight up said that if warren does nt run  or another progressive  that he would run no one stepped into the race so he did 
0,alright  i got ta jump in here i know that most of reddit absolutely loves warren  but she is just as big of a politico as clinton or rubio i m from a small suburb of boston  and i guarantee if you mentioned it to her  she would nt know where it is she does nt do much  in my opinion  for the commonwealth she represents  opting instead to work for national causes  she s a carpet bagging technocrat from harvard law who was crowned  just like clinton  by the dnc amp  dccc to take ted kennedy s seat back from scott brown  who won it by beating the last anointed ma senate candidate  martha coakley  who was acting like hrc is now when she was campaigning  like she inherited the job   i know on the national stage she is a progressive hero  but as somebody she is supposed to represent right now  i feel that she is using massachusetts like so many other aspirational politicians  patrick  romney  brown  callahan  etc   stepping on our heads on the way to dc 
0,please  please  i beseech you all  stop with the vp talk it will not happen and should not happen warren far more valuable and powerful in the senate 
0,she might get nominated for the scotus vacancy 
0,warren for vp  sanders  warren 2016
0,i identify as a pretty middleoftheroad independent  socially liberal  fiscally conservative  and i d feel a hell of a lot better voting for warren than sanders 
0,so sanders runs because he feels he must  that the country needs his policies and pretty much every other candidate in either party runs because of personal ambition 
0,not sure why she s bothering  as she s guaranteed the nomination 
0,nothing is more powerful than an idea whose time has come  this killed hillarys campaign in 2008 as democrats were euphoric over electing the first black president  and undecided  independent voters were leery of the clinton brand and the negatives that come with it  its 2016 wall street greed sucker punched the world to its knees in 2008 young voters are looking at a  still  broken health care system  staggering college loan debt  skyrocketing housing costs  stagnant wages in a time of record corporate profits and trillion dollar cash hoards  and hillary clinton  while repeatedly cashing enormous speaking engagement checks and donations from wall street and big healthcare  pharma  keeps attempting to tell voters that she is the change agent that will fix wall street and healthcare  bernie sanders is like a genie that popped out of the bottle at exactly the right moment in time  who appeals to all the voters put off by clinton for reasons i just mentioned 
0,i think clinton would make a really good   gop   candidate  especially considering the current field of gop candidates 
0,she lost iowa in 2008 and won new hampshire and had a smaller national lead 
0,you did nt say it in your dream  carson you said it out loud on front of everyone you are awake this is the real life you were nt supposed to say it out loud 
0,this is such an obvious thing it almost has to go without saying if there was a republican president  the debate would ve gone like this   should president republican nominate a replacement justice   and then every candidate would ve said   of course  that s what the constitution says  if the democrats try to block the nomination they re clearly trying to impede democracy there s historical precedent of nominating justices  there s so much hypocrisy in modern politics it s disgusting at least admit that you only want obama to wait because he s not going to nominate a judge you agree with 
0,gt  carson said the supreme court has become a  political tool   adding that it might be time to look at term limits for the justices   when we enacted that program  the average age of death was 47 and now it  s 80 you know  things have changed  so we need to change with them   carson said  i m confused is ben carson making a well reasoned argument 
0,carson surprised me for once 
0,this precedent the gop speaks of  does not exist   http  wwwscotusblogcom201602supremecourtvacanciesinpresidentialelectionyears  
0,carson said something not crazy 
0,am i wrong or did they choose that photo as an homage to the kermit meme 
0,carson woke up just long enough to make a valid point but by the time the last word left his lips his eyes had returned to their familiar glazed appearance 
0,gt  then again  recognize that the two picks that the president has selected are ideologues  so there  s really no reason to believe that his next pick wouldn  t be an ideologue also  a  we d have to go back to anthony kennedy probably to find a supreme court nominee who was nt an ideologue  and even then  most were surprised kennedy s voting record turned out to be moderate  b  the president has nt picked yet therefore no one knows if this pick  who does not yet exist  is an ideologue  or not no one knows who it is  no one has had a chance to examine the person s record no one has had a chance to interview the person and to find out their thoughts and positions  basically  obama could pick someone so conservative that they make scalia seem like a bleedingheart liberal  and the republicans would still be opposed no on substance  but because its obama s pick they are opposed to everything obama does because obama did it they disagree with much of what obama does for substantive reasons  of course  but with all of it for the childish reason of trying to prevent obama from doing anything at all  even when they agree with him 
0,i respect him for being honest about this are we really expecting politicians to lie to us  that s terrible 
0,the voice of reason comes from the weirdest places sometimes 
0,thank you for confirming our suspicions  ben  mighty neighborly of ya 
0,god damnit  mitch mcconnel is so mcawful that he s making me agree with ben carson  fuck off  you obstinate turtle 
0, carson said the supreme court has become a  political tool   adding that it might be time to look at term limits for the justices  holy fuck  ben carson just said something i actually  agree  with feels weird  man 
0,the egyptians would nt wait for the pharaoh to die to fill the pyramids with grain 
0,ben carson does nt want to be president  he wants to make a good show of things so he can charge tons of money in speaking fees that s called  pulling a palin  
0,i just want to say that this thumbnail is perfect 
0,does anyone else find it ironic that scalia would not agree with limiting terms of justices as carson throws out at the end 
0,i think most recognize he is allowed to nominate but the senate is still allowed to deny it
0,aw shit it must be the end times  because i agree with everything ben carson said in that article
0,jesus christ i ca nt think of a better thumbnail than that for this post he s like  i m just saying you know 
0,thank you  captain obvious 
0,i see they forgot to keep drugging his coffee 
0,of course is this really not common knowledge  do people really not realize it s an attempt to let a republican president nominate someone 
0, sips coffee  but thats none of my business 
0,he s entirely right  the only reason that republicans are complaining about obama being able to appoint a nominee for justice is because they fear that he ll pick someone that they do nt like  the republicans all agree that obama is  undermining the constitution   those are words taken straight from marco rubio s mouth   but when he has a  constitutional duty  to perform  they scream  he s gon na pick someone we do nt like  he should nt obey the law   hippocracy at its best 
0,of course not it s all posturing
0,lucid dreaming ftw 
0,scalia relied on textualism and originalism on the bench republicans loved him then  ben carson  who is seeking the republican nomination  says  things change  we should change with them  wut happen 2 originalism ben 
0,smartest thing he s ever said 
0,just saying
0,that has got to be the first god damn thing he s said that sounds sane the whole bit was very rational 
0,even a broken clock is right twice a day 
0,well duh seriously  they just need to drop the act  we re going to block anyone obama picks because he s a democrat and we re republicans and we do nt want them gaining any more power it s politics  just say it we already know it  seriously  i would respect them more if they would quit pretending it has something to do with the american people choosing 
0,why is he still running  he obviously does nt care about his image in the party anymore 
0,no one actually cares  no republican  be they voter or legislator  gives a shit about whether there s precedent for stalling like this  and most of them are nt even pretending to does it prevent obama from achieving his agenda  then they re for it it s that simple 
0,until the last 25 years or so  the increase in life expectancy was due to the decrease in infant mortality and childhood diseases if you survived until adulthood  your chance of a full life was pretty good 
0,well  he s right 
0,reason among the republicans   or does it just look reasonable out of context 
0,sleepy ben said what everyone already knew  risky bet ben  let s see how it plays out 
0,what happened to carson  
0, come on  ben  memorize your lines  and say only your lines   marco rubotio
0,wow the pubs sure are getting pretty good at blurting out the things that everybody already knows but denies 
0,no shit the democrats know this the gop knows this obama knows this my 8 year old even knows this everyone knows this this wo nt stop the gop from being a bunch of obstructionist hypocrites  however 
0,the real question is  how did the reporter manage to get a full quote  every single reporter who has interviewed carson dozed off half way into the first sentence 
0,not only did he call the gop a bunch of hypocrites  but he also put forth an argument against the whole conservative ideology at the end lol 
0,wait did fucken ben carson have a moment of lucidity and logic  something grounded in reality and an analysis of the situation argued from logos instead of ethos  holy fucken shit 
0,and democrats would stonewall the fuck out of them  what else is new 
0,i m pretty sure carson does nt know what the word ideologue means 
0,it has been almost 40 years since the love canal  and this is still happening we need to make some changes to  politics as usual 
0,wow  what he says is so true and spot on  part of me would take it further and start demanding prosecution of the people in power that made or allowed this to happen 
0,send the military and the plumbers in rip that water system apart and replace it i know that will still take a while  but the city is in ruined condition major overhaul required
0,perhaps this is a reminder of what may happen when we expand government to do  everything   little considering that taxpayers do nt have enough money for  everything  i wonder what the city  county  and national governments associated with flint have spent on projects over the last 20 years that were less important than replacing lead pipes that bring water into people s homes  or understanding that the chemistry of drinking water is indeed important when lead pipes are still extant you can try to make this a democrat  republican  liberal  conservative issue  but it s really a demonstration of how government systems can go wrong when the servants of the people lose interest in their service  and the people lose sight of demanding government do basic things before it starts doing political things 
0,2016  0 1 6 
0,er  does sanders not realize that state budgets in no way reflect federal budgets  state budgets do not cover wars  as that is federal military spending 
0,and none for kanye either all this money wasting overseas and nothing for our rappers back home 
0,even more infuriating is that the government lets wealthy and well connected criminals get away with things like poisoning the water supply 
0,infinite money for the f35 that will be rendered obsolete by the first dogfighting supersonic drone none for flint 
0,is president bernie going to be perpetually outraged at his own administration when things go wrong 
0,2016 0 1 6 but this a failure on the government of flint  not the free market  from what i ve seen the free market has actually been doing a lot to offset some of horrible conditions there i do nt know how many articles i ve seen of celebrities donating free water to flint for publicity  including bernie himself 
0,gt  the atlanta democrat made his decision public just hours before sanders is set to speak at a morehouse college rally aimed at enticing black voters to give his campaign a second look fort  who is also considering a run for atlanta mayor    had endorsed clinton weeks ago    gt     after months of looking at bernie  s record and studying his positions   on healthcare  wall street  predatory lending and the minimum wage    i came to the conclusion that bernie  s position on the issues that affect my constituents in georgia the most conform most closely to my positions     said fort  really  it s all that it takes  compare and contrast hillary and bernie s record and platform the more people study bernie  the more likely they ll support him this is just one of many congressmen and women who will flip their endorsements 
0,i live in marietta i just called senator fort s office to say  thank you  for his support of senator sanders 
0,good for him  but why is it front page news that a state senator flips  are we that desperate for positive bernie news that we ll upvote even a minor thing like this and proclaim it as the beginning of the end 
0,gt  the no2 democrat in the georgia senate bernie endorsed by the democratic establishment

0,he was supporting someone like clinton until now 
0,fort has lots of enemies in both parties hahaha he s a prominent figure but not that prominent some would say he s a joke 
0,and so it begins 
0,i am i the only one who think that this is the opposite of the point i want people to support bernie because the majority of the democratic party members want to support him i do not want people flipping their support without counting a single vote in georgia 
0,someone remind me  is it  rats leaving a sinking ship  or  cockroaches leaving a sinking wall street whore  
0,proud to be georgian today  edit  hahaha i have no idea why i m being downvoted  must be the hillary brigade

0,didnt illinoisa state that is consistently blue  just elect a republican governor 
0,hundreds  that s not a lot of people  and before someone points out building capacity  you pick your venues based on how many people you re expecting 
0,its impressive when a campaign surrogate can pull in hundreds of people while most candidates themselves usually speak crowds of 50 to 100 on their campaign 
0,see many hipsters  not surprised 
0,they do nt have jobs 
0,i legitimately ca nt decide which political move is more out of touch with reality  1 hillary boasting about having henry kissenger s support  2 jeb using george w on the campaign trail  it s madness it s absolute madness 
0,so this is just jeb s final hail mary move  right 
0,the other night trump was met which a chorus of boos for daring to challenge the conservative spin that  george w kept our country safe  trump pointed out that 911 occurred during the bush regime  despite warnings from the cia that this attack was imminent in a report titled   osama bin laden destined to strike in the united states  or something like that  trump also pointed out that bush s destabilizing influence is what created isis and emboldened terrorists in that destabilized region  which is also tantamount to not exactly keeping us safe  the howl of horrified boos from the audience was amazing  as though each of them was drinking the same koolaid
0,the really sad thing is that w looks like winston churchill compared to current crop of gop candidates
0,we need to dispel this notion that jeb bush knows what he s doing jeb bush has no fucking clue what he is doing 
0,jeb needs to get his mommy to help him campaign  and when that does nt work he calls in his brother who is nationally regarded as responsible for many of the problems we face as a country today  please clap 
0,jeb s mother told him to have george speak 
0,remember w was handed a surplus in 2001 and squandered it with incredibly irresponsible tax cuts during time of war the us is the only country in the history of the world to cut taxes during time of war conservatives have no standing to complain about the national debt because largely they caused it  now that we are in the paul ryan era  the budget deficit and national debt any more is absolutely intentional because they will use it to justify cuts in social security and medicare and anything else that does nt benefit the 1   it s the grover norquist method 
0,did you guys watch the speeches  i think it helped him people who do nt want anything to do with the bush family can snicker all they want  but it was definitely a plus for jeb bush has a 70  approval rating with republican voters it ll help with the nomination at least  w warmed up the crowd and jeb had a tough act to follow and it lit a flame jeb has never spoken with so much furor before it s a newer jeb  but probably too late to change much but  if jeb continues with the same confidence as yesterday he could climb to 2nd place rationally  in the very least it bought in the spotlight and people actually can hear about jeb s stance on things 
0,funny how the american media ca nt write stories like these but then  they would have to implicate themselves in absolute failure that was 43 s presidency 
0,i picture jeb  not wanting george to campain for him  but being to bashful to tell him 
0,you know it s bad when you re bringing in dubya to help out on the campaign trail 
0,it s also a reminder that the  burn it all down  mentality has its consequences people did protest votes against gore and the country has  in fact  burn to the ground in many respects a full  third  of our debt   66trillion  is from the bush tax cuts alone  and another 10    17trillion  is from the war in iraq we re looking at thousands dead and maimed servicemen and women and a foreign policy that has directly contributed to the rise of isis and islamic extremism in the middle east civil liberties have been rolled back with the usa patriot act  usa is part of the acronym   and bushappointed alito is practically trying to outcompete thomas for archconservative on the court  which gave us citizens united and nearly derailed the aca 
0,i saw this story in australia and thought  oh well if another bush gets in at least we might get four more years of quality punk songs after an eight year hiatus

0,anybody else watch the sean hannity interview with jeb  and george while thinking to themselves   thank god  yahweh  allah  shiva  buddha  zeus  odin  and anyone else listening that man is nt president anymore  
0,i really think it s time for the us to have more political parties it s pretty obvious that both republicans and dems are sick and tired of their own parties we got a guy who calls himself a socialist and a real estate tycoon reality show star as front runners time for a reality check 
0,of course he s going to support his brother it s crazy to think he would nt

0,obama looks at bush   it s not my fault  he roped me into it  bush looks at clinton   well he roped me into it  clinton plays his saxophonewearing a small badge that reads  first black president 
0,just to remind people what the george w bush presidency was really like  lie on top of lie  https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  yykc4gd2id4 also  the lehman brothers subprime mortgage scheme that drained  7t out of the us economy  sending the us into the great recession of 2008 was concocted early in the bush presidency  somebody will eventually write the true history and legacy of the bush family  from george hw bush to george w bush  and it will expose a family that very nearly destroyed the us 
0,i am not which president in my lifetime has a anything but a disastrous legacy even obama is nt going to be remembered fondly for some of the actions of the us during his presidency  if anything he seemed to double down on everything bush did wrong
0,i swear to god  barbara had to be smoking weed or eating lead paint chips while pregnant with those two w looks like he s got mange on the top of his head  and i love how laura just stands there next to him  without a clue  waving like a retard at everyone  she looks great by the way  regardless of what people try to say now  george w bush was one of the worst president s this country has ever had there s a mile long list of horrifically bad things his administration brought about  from 911 to the patriot act colin powell and rumsfeld were the only two competent people who came out of that administration  do nt forget  cheney created the nsa and the psychotic nsa contractor where the concept of ass raping and torturing innocent americans is somehow making us all safe 
0,7 years later  still blaming bush 
0,george w bush belongs in the hague  as do cheney and rumsfeld 
0,its his brother  its not surprising its like bill supporting hillary

0,alright  i got ta jump in here i know that most of reddit absolutely loves warren  but she is just as big of a politico as clinton or rubio i m from a small suburb of boston  and i guarantee if you mentioned it to her  she would nt know where it is she does nt do much  in my opinion  for the commonwealth she represents  opting instead to work for national causes  she s a carpet bagging technocrat from harvard law who was crowned  just like clinton  by the dnc amp  dccc to take ted kennedy s seat back from scott brown  who won it by beating the last anointed ma senate candidate  martha coakley  who was acting like hrc is now when she was campaigning  like she inherited the job   i know on the national stage she is a progressive hero  but as somebody she is supposed to represent right now  i feel that she is using massachusetts like so many other aspirational politicians  patrick  romney  brown  callahan  etc   stepping on our heads on the way to dc 
0,elizabeth warren is the goldman sach s wolf in sheep s clothing do nt buy into her bullshit 
0,can we take a moment to discuss the picture in the article  i like bernie  but that image has a serious supervillanpracticinghisevillaugh vibe 
0,did nt some prohillary supporters  along with most media  say weeks ago  and for months on end  that even if bernie managed to win iowa and new hampshire that nevada would be his death knell because it had a large minority population and that bernie would nt be able to attract said minority voters  hmmm  oh now it s 80  white  great keep moving that goal post  gt  her staff repeatedly claimed that nevada was as white as the first two early states this was not only risibly false  but a clear sign that she wasn  t just lowering expectations but showing real fear she could lose nevada  february 20th ca nt come soon enough 
0,as a californian who just spent the weekend in nevada  you can tell her campaign there is getting desperate she has an ad in every tv commercial spot i d say the ratio of clinton to sanders ads were about 8  1 the one where she s  spent her life fighting for the childrens   i ve heard at least fifty times 
0,i m from nevada and me and my family are caucusing for bernie but i ve mostly been seeing hillary ads and ppl canvassing for hillary hopefully the turnout for saturday is more pro bernie
0,where can i find more nevada polls  rcp does nt have that many recent ones 
0, the clinton panic is palpable 
0,that thumbnail edit  not seeing it  disable subreddit style 
0,can confirm am nevadan voting sanders 
0,i will be really satisfied if the final presidential nominees are bernie sanders and donald trump because it means the system is nt completely broken and we re only offered the choices of gop or goplite 
0,well  bernie needs to win nevada or sc or else he s done for on super tuesday  so nevada is definitely his best chance 
0,i m in nevada and not registered as a democrat i was nt going to go because of this but saw a billboard for bernie here that says i can change the registration at the time of the caucus i m definitely going to go because of this and show my support fuck hilary 
0,i m a bit confused why should clinton be panicking about nevada   so far  all the polls are showing clinton in the lead by 10  or more   http  wwwrealclearpoliticscomepolls2016presidentnvnevada_democratic_presidential_caucus5337html  
0,maybe that s why the media is all but dismissing it it would mess up her whole diversity argument 
0,ralston is a moron i follow him pretty closely his reporting is great he always shows up and says what he sees  his analysis is yellow journalism garbage he wants page hits so he s going to spin this as a controversy when in reality he has no idea what is going on 
0,i do nt know why anyone ever claimed it was  considering how little polling was done in that state 
0,butbutsmug and condescending hillary supporters assured me that bernie could nt win in nevada  because nonwhite people 
0,bernie looks like he s about to ascend to heaven in that pic 
0,er  does sanders not realize that state budgets in no way reflect federal budgets  state budgets do not cover wars  as that is federal military spending 
0,i think her problem is that her understanding of how to do politics is quintessentially out of date she thinks you trade favors for progress she thinks you identify with people by feigning a common identity most damaging  imo  is that she still thinks of herself as part of an oppressed class all that seems corrupt and fake today 
0,man  that site really shat up my browser  afraid i was unable to read the article

0,how could they do this to their own abuela 
0,if you re a nonwhite american voter in nevada or south carolina  would nt you be a little angry to be regarded as part of a firewall  by this lady 
0,as an asian american  i m always a bit envious of minorities like blacks and hispanics who actually get touched upon in political campaigns and who people  journalists  activists  seem to always care about  the only asian firewall you ll hear of in the news is in china and its the technical usage of the term firewall 
0,god the lack of good polls pisses me off  i have no idea how to feel about nevada 
0,hillary s firewall is getting berned 
0,is nt saying  blacks are my firewall  or  latinos are my firewall  a bit weird   why did she start using that  firewall  phrase  
0,uh other way around latinos are losing faith in hrc 
0,of course they are the reality is that the more latinos and blacks learn about sanders  the more likely they will vote for him the only hurdle for them is awareness sanders  policies will make their lives better  period clinton s policies will just be the same old dc bullshit would you choose a better life or a shit life 
0, oh  no  my abuela  
0,he was polling at like 35  among hispanics a few months ago with his recent surge i would nt be surprised if he was tied with her or even ahead now

0,man  both her and trump expect mexicans to build walls for them 
0,why the fuck is everything a firewall these days  why did i never hear this term any other election cycle 
0,i m in las vegas and i m switching from republican to democrat today so i can vote bernie on the 20th my family is probably gon na disown me but fuckem 
0,the way we keep using this  firewall  phrase  it sounds like she uses the bodies of the impoverished minorities to protect her fortune very disturbing image when you think about it 
0,hillary won the popular vote 
0,heh strange how vox quotes  latino firewall  in the headline but not in the article and in no way makes any indication of whom they re quoting i do nt believe i ve ever heard clinton use the term  latino firewall  so as for now  that s just vox saying stupid shit for clicks which is par for course 
0,the only people using the term  firewall  are in the media  usually in a way that is negative towards hrc s campaign  and yet redditors jump on the  this is offensive  bandwagon lol  wtf 
0,yes  let s all vote for the old white career politician 
0,please  please  i beseech you all  stop with the vp talk it will not happen and should not happen warren far more valuable and powerful in the senate 
0,if he would pick her for vp i d lose it that s the dream team 
0,the dnc is in a tight spot they ve put a lot of time  money  and effort into clinton  and are now increasingly willing to send good money after bad if they think that there s still a chance that they can pull clinton out of her nosedive to get her the nomination  they can similarly delude themselves into thinking that  by the general  the email thing will have blown over  especially if clinton herself has not been candid with the democratic leadership about what was on that system because  she  believes that they will have no choice but to back her if she can get the nomination  do nt operate under the assumption that just because the dnc establishment wants hillary as the nominee and hillary wants the support of the dnc that either trusts the other  honestly  one of the more damning things for clinton was the house gop taking a step back and just saying   you know what  we think the fbi s got this covered 
0,her supporters have admitted as such by saying there is no way the administration would prosecute if a crime is determined to have been committed and no charges are brought  that s the definition of protection 
0,newsmax 
0,she has problems with firewalls lately
0,r e k t e k t
0,well  he probably is nt wrong for what it s worth  if the fbi recommends indictment and the doj goes all  nolo prosequi  brosef  it wo nt be because there is nt enough evidence to get it done 
0,the gop made it so i do nt even care anymore if she broke the law to many witch hunts if they do take her down i will be surprised 
0,yes bernie sanders is complicit in protecting hillary 
0,this trump guy is just a litigious snitch 
0,number 2 ranking democratic state senator will likely decide the race in georgia where hillary clinton is up by only 30
0,too bad he does nt carry a superdelegate vote 
0,i knew and loved warren before i ever heard of sanders  but i think he has a better chance than warren would ve while he has the age and jewish thing against him  warren has almost no history in politics compared to clinton  elected to senate in 2013  and the difference would ve been far starker

0,tl  dw  voter turn out numbers this year were  lower  this year in new hampshire than compared to 2008 because 2008 had a much bigger getoutthevote machine with 8 democratic candidates while 2016 only has 2 candidates in absolute terms  bernie sanders shattered the record with 150k votes  with the previous record holder being hillary with 112k votes conclusion  bernie is turning out voters 
0,bernies revolution has to do with congress and the senate right  thats the main premise of his ability to get his policies enacted  to have a revolution  although im sure the republicans will say its to start a communist revolutionary takeover by playing ads with the soviet national anthem im actually looking forward to what kinds of bullshit they will try and throw at him 
0,boy  that guy sure takes his sweet fucking time getting to the point  does nt he  that s why i do nt listen to talk radio regardless of political leaning 
0,really  because i see news stories about bernie sanders all the time 
0,man  those the media guys sure are jerks why  they even give me a feeling like i m a victim sometimes 
0,i wish people would stop calling it a political revolution it only brings to mind maoist china when you say it like that 
0,and hillary clinton still commands an equal if not greater following  but you wo nt hear that on reddit 
0, gt  complains about censorship  gt  removes all posts mentioning trump and how well he is doing

0, the media is cheating me   every politician ever if you believe it  you re an idiot especially in this case the media actually has massive financial incentive to have a close race between sanders and clinton political ads bring tons of money to television stations  radio stations  etc the closer the race  the more money the candidates are going to spend trying to eek out the victory

0,voting is nt a revolution call me when there s barricades on the streets  homeslice 
0,tldw  bernie got more votes than any candidate in the new hampshire primary has ever gotten before 
0,i think the real revolution is towards someone more moderate i ve seen inklings of trump s realization of this i think the candidates have made the mistake of running to the extremes kasich could grab into this trend if he had more charisma  the person in the middle in november will win

0,hahahahahahahahahaha
0,the  revolution  is real it s a rejection of globalist neoconservatism  being  policeman of the world   supporting us global hegemony at all costs i have bad news for bernie supporters  the revolution also rejects the agenda of the  globalist left  as well  through overwhelming public support for shutting down illegal immigration and curtailing legal immigration as well for years and years  the globalist left s political strategy has been to import thirdworld voters who support their agenda and do everything in their power to make sure they vote  reject voterid laws  bus people to polls  advocate compulsory voting  and even complain about how nebulous  oppression  causes disenfranchisement rather than pure apathy and lack of agency

0,as someone who used to be responsible for a companies website  keeping domains and secure certificates current  you have to be really fucking stupid to let them expire not just because of what happened but you start getting reminders well before it expires  so to let it expire you purposely have to ignore it  or be so incompetent to assign your notifications to a nonmonitored email address you also have the option for automatic renewal if you ca nt be bothered to read your email plus you would think they would have paid for enough time to actually cover the campaign season

0,gt  it s very important in the long run  to elect a woman for president    says 53yearold lisa mcallister  i think we ve seen that with president obama  that he s brought racial issues to the forefront that we need to have at the forefront it s more than women s turn to have a woman in the white house    obama has not brought racial issues to the forefront   whatever attention is being paid to racial issues in this country is entirely due to people recording instances of police brutality towards black people and circulating them online black lives matter would not exist if not for these recordings the fact that black lives matter exists at all during an obama presidency is a sign that he has nt done anything nearly enough to address racial issues in this country    electing a black president has not solved racism electing a woman president will not solve sexism  
0,way to misrepresent the story its a story about generation divide in nevada 
0,facebook videos  the deciding factor in choosing a president this is the future we choose

0,i m willing to bet that most of hillary supporters  or any nonbernie supporters  who have nt seen a single video of bernie will at least entertain the idea of jumping ship once they do see one of his videos  i like this one in particular   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  ru3nkvvxcss 
0,as much as i like sanders over other candidates  as a nonamerican   all these articles on reddit praising sanders seem like all the politically spun election ads you can find for other candidates 
0,random black person says they are voting for bernie  to the front page
0,not sure we need to be quoting lowinformation voters here five minutes on google will tell you all of the candidates  positions if you re undecided until hearing them speak  frankly  you re a fucking moron 
0,why the fuck is a random person s opinion on the front page of rpolitics  oh  right  the bernie cult 
0,the same thing happen to mewhen i saw a donal trump video  now i m for him 
0,i would like to see some more realistic  pragmatic ideas rather than vague populist rhetoric every reddit article is the same kind of thing   bernie is right on poverty  i think it s bad to be poor  and people should be able to have money to buy things   i mean  i see a lot of complaints and virtually no plausible solutions being offered from bernie i m very skeptical of this kind of politician i appreciate his detachment from corporate benefactors in his campaign  though and  i think he does care  where i think hillary is probably a more shrewd politician rather than some compassionate visionary 
0,rsandersforpresident2
0,if this woman changed her vote entirely after watching a facebook video of hillary clinton  she d be accused of being a shill and shit on seven different ways here 
0,i like bernie  but this is rsandersforpresident or rcirclejerk material
0,wow how limited do you have to be to totally swayed by one viewing of a video 
0,voting for someone because of a facebook video nice 
0,she cared   more   about his passionoratory not about the content 
0,there is certainly an age gap going on here it seems as if the only retort that hillary supporters can muster is  young people are too naive to know that they should support clinton  this seems similar to their other arguments  eg  women who support bernie are not real feminists  men who support bernie are sexist  berniebros    considering the incredible skill that young people have in accessing good and relativelyunbiased information quickly using modern technology  the position that young people are naive or underinformed seems to fall flat considering older generations  reliance on outdated information media technologies for their information  media that is largely controlled by corporate clinton supporters  it may be that it is the older generation of voters who are both naive and underinformed  i d like to hear other people s thoughts on this 
0,i still fail to see how the sex of the potus is in any way relevant 
0,anyone who votes for hillary clinton because she s a woman is what s wrong with this country if you took even 1 hour to do some research on who your electing for to be the freaking commander and chief of our country you would realize that bernie is way more trustworthy of your vote then hillary the lord of lies 
0,a woman president lifts the glass ceiling for literally one person any president who is committed to helping women can help women  regardless of gender 
0,i know reddit just  loves  hitler comparisons by inference  but hitler  strom thurmond  even donald trump are passionate speakers that alone is not enough  i m not lumping sen sanders in that group  but i get actively pissed reading insipid supporter perspectives like this  no matter who the candidate of topic is  be it a feel the berner or a tea bagger  we get the democracy we deserve  if we do nt dug deeper than a passionate message  i fear even a donald trump could be considered a politically viable candidate 
0,this sub and the people on it are literally the worst  bernie sanders wipes his mouth politely after eating a sandwich   4500 upvotes  bunch of antitrade  ca nt do math  think taxes are only paid by businesses  free health care  even though you re 20 and have about a 00001  chance of needing serious medical coverage  wanting morons 
0,it s pretty obvious pandering here by bernies social media team  looking for the black vote ahead of sc watch this kind of racial political news hit the front page everyday 
0,i m from the uk so i do nt know too much about us politics a few months ago  i d never heard in the last of bernie sanders  but everything i have seen and heard in the last few weeks makes me hope for the sake of the us  and the world  that bernie wins  there is so much crap going on in the world right now  and he seems the only genuine chance the us people have of starting to get things right 
0,gt  sanders  support is more pronounced among young women especially one survey showed women voters under 35 preferred sanders by an almost 20point margin  while young men preferred him only by 4 points  so in fact  ms  steinem  not where all the boys are 
0,wow  the older voters in this audio are condescending as all hell to millenials 
0,hitler was also a passionate and consistent speaker  i do nt use that as my major decision point when electing someone 
0,i too think everything should be free for me and paid for by others
0,tldr   i too  am stupid

0,so she wants a token female in the oval office  yeah because that will solve all gender equality issues 
0,obama was a great speaker  passionate  and spoke of change  but history is useless  clearly  if no one remembers it in 8 years 
0,it s especially humorous because it s only  older democratic women  are  supposed  to go blindly hillary s way  because it s time for a woman candidate to be elected  men seem to be strangely irrelevant no  it s just that voters can actually do whatever they feel like  amazingly and bernie sanders tells the truth and we like it and hillary s simply a skilled politician  although i realize most of you poor sap s ignore it anyway but enough of them  believe me  are listening intently  and are voting with their feet for bernie 
0,how  take a look at every other developed countries for example in my country  france  id are free  every small city hall can generate them  employers ca nt refuse their employees to take a day off  paid   to go to their city hall every citizen has one if tomorrow politicians tried to stop the need of a id to vote we would have a new civil war 
0,back when hillary ran against obama  i remember thinking that she would make a better president than obama  but that she could never win a general election i do nt remember disliking her  even when she went a bit negative  this year it s a bit different i still believe she is absolutely incapable of winning a general election the republicans just hate her too much the base will come out to vote against her  even if they wo nt come out to support trump or cruz or whatever empty suit they nominate  but this year  i m finding myself really disliking clinton on so many counts  her platform simply wo nt solve our problems her motives are clearly all about hillary her rhetoric is so crafted to mislead she s attacking a guy who has refused to attack her back  hillary is pretending to steal bernie s issues  without having the decency to actually do so she offers weaker versions of his plans  but claims they are stronger and she uses cheap rhetorical tricks to obfuscate the differences between her plans and bernies it s not a battle of ideas for her it s just manipulation and taking advantage of the confusion she s deliberately causing  she s clearly taken too much money from too many special interests to ever be impartial  let alone tough on their industries  worst of all is her condescending tone when speaking to young people she refuses to acknowledge their problems  and does nt seem at all interested in actually courting them she does nt think their votes matter she s sure they ll stay home i would nt mind all this if her actual platform and agenda was going to improve their lives but it wo nt  because has no understanding of their problems  i just ca nt vote for hillary i just ca nt she s a bad  bad candidate she will be a terrible president  i might get out and vote against donald trump getting the nuclear codes  if it comes to that but i m praying bernie pulls off the upset

0,that reads like a proclinton push poll it did nt even ask about which candidate they d support  luckily it was nt a telephone survey  although pushpolling by telephone is also a thing  it s taking things pretty far  even for an unscientific survey  gt  1  sanders could be elected as president in november  as americans reject concerns over his identity as a  democratic socialist  okay  strong opening  gt  2  clinton is a betterqualified candidate because of her experience as the wife of a president  a senator and secretary of state  oh dear  if you were expecting a question here also regaling sanders  past career and marital status  you d be mistaken  gt  3  both candidates are actively vying for the votes of africanamericans those voters have better reasons to support  okay  without controlling for demographics  this does nt mean _anything_ gt  4  it is important to me that clinton be elected this year as the first woman president in us history  oh my 
0,i identify as a pretty middleoftheroad independent  socially liberal  fiscally conservative  and i d feel a hell of a lot better voting for warren than sanders 
0,could there be a sanderswarren ticket 
0,sanders straight up said that if warren does nt run  or another progressive  that he would run no one stepped into the race so he did 
0,i would bet that if bernie wins the nomination warren will be top choice for vpgiven bernie s age it would be a coup if she accepted 
0,bernie is only running because elizabeth did nt

0,if sanders loses this election  she will win in 2020 by a 51 margin 
0,so sanders runs because he feels he must  that the country needs his policies and pretty much every other candidate in either party runs because of personal ambition 
0,i have nt looked in a while but it seems as these two are very compatible as politicians maybe they could go as running mates

0, me      republican heads explode    
0,as i posted on a different thread  i can not recall  or google  a supreme court candidate being nominated twice hence  if the senate is sincere about rejecting any and all nominees then whoever obama puts forward will be sacrificed it makes for an interesting decision in the white house  nominate the most appropriatedeserving and potentially lose them forever  or nominate a second tier candidate

0,that s what happens when you create stuff like dhs and use the patriot act to crush our rights 
0,dont forget to thank gwb for the tsa and the rest of homeland security now can someone please refresh my memory  what was the last terrorist attack they prevented   crickets 
0,apparently  when bill clinton declared that  the era of big government is over   he failed to account for republicans regaining control of the executive branch 
0,that s the slowest expansion of government since eisenhower
0,let s clarify this headline  during bush  13  more people joined the government payroll under obama  it continued to grow  but only by 8   the obama years have more federal employees than the bush years the government did not get leaner  it simply got bigger slower 
0,i m a democrat but come on  that was largely a result of the 2008 crisis and a maximalist congress
0,small government 
0,thanks feeorg no better case for a third party in this country i was already voting no on the leftright 2016 
0,to be fair to obama  after all the bush govt bloating there was nt a lot let for him to do 
0,we should probably appoint a committee to carry out a study to examine just how much bureaucracy has increased oh  government  never change 
0,yea  the gop are such hypocrites 
0,that s good for bush right  government bureaucracy is good for our economy think of the new bureaucratic jobs that will become available when america s entire health care industry is absorbed by the federal government under president bernie sanders we are about to put george bush to shame as far as government growth is concerned 
0,and thus  the birth of the tea party 
0,to be clear  this link discusses the growth in the number of us bureaucratic employees  is the number of employees added to the government payroll the best metric for how big a government is  or even an adequate metric 
0,small government my ass   
0,booooooooooo facts 
0,to all the people saying  how hard it is to get an id  seriously  do a little research into how these states are making it as hard as possible closing down dmvs  requiring a birth certificate  but only the official one  not a copy more forms of id than was needed just a few years ago it s a pain in the ass and poor folks are affected by it a lot more that is entirely the point  you can drive your car and it s totally doable  great  now use public transport to go across town and spend hours at a now overcrowded dmv that has fucky hours that your job is nt friendly about giving you time for  a lot of poor folks get it done  but it fucks up an entire week of getting all the proper shit together it s maddening and it s never been needed before  why now  this research shows you exactly why now  i did nt need a birth certificate when i got my class a licence why did i need it to renew it 
0,well duh  if the repugs are responsible for implementing anything  then by definition it s biased against democrats and minorities the gop  the party of old  rich  white people oh yeah  add in scared to that list 
0,they re modern day jim crow laws
0,i m a big sanders supporter  but you got ta admit this was just clinton being smooth as fuck he sweettalked a curator and offered to pick up some litter so he could bring a date into an empty museum that is god damned romantic and in no way political 
0,somehow i thought this would be about them working in place of strikers  the usual meaning of  cross the picket line  which i did think was an odd choice for s first date for anyone curious here is the full quote  from hillary  around which the article is based ethical or not  your choice  i m just providing the quote for those who do nt feel like clicking  gt  we both had wanted to see a mark rothko exhibit at the yale art gallery but  because of a labor dispute  some of the university s buildings  including the museum  were closed as bill and i walked by  he decided he could get us in if we offered to pick up the litter that had accumulated in the gallery s courtyard watching him talk our way in was the first time i saw his persuasiveness in action we had the entire museum to ourselves we wandered through the galleries talking about rothko and twentiethcentury art i admit to being surprised at his interest in and knowledge of subjects that seemed  at first  unusual for a viking from arkansas we ended up in the museum s courtyard  where i sat in the large lap of henry moore s sculpture drape seated woman while we talked until dark 
0,scabs 
0,the actual story here is pretty neat and only solidifies my affection for bill
0,jesus fucking christ they were nt going in as scab workers bill lied about cleaning up the place to get in so he could have an evening alone with his lady this is like a scene from a shitty romantic comedy  not some insightful view into the clinton s neocon leanings for fucks sake can we concentrate on actual fucking issues and not try to convince each other that america s most prominent family of civil servants is evil because their names are nt bernie and sanders 
0,this is a cool story they did nothing wrong it was a creative way to see some interesting art and  in bill s case  a way to impress the girl you like 
0,so bill clinton  as a college kid  conned his way into a museum and had it all to themselves  but this is now a story about how bill and hillary were scabs  and therefore can now be construed to be secretly antilabor  this fucking sub has lost all sense of perspective 
0,just came here to say bill looks glorious in that photo 
0,the two top posts on rpoliticsrising   on bill and hillary clinton  s first date in 1971  they crossed a picket line   rodham and clinton were offering themselves as replacement labor  blunting  if only temporarily  the effects of the strike on the university   king  amazing archival video appears to show the arrest of a young bernie sanders as a student activist in chicago
0,wow this is hilariously over the top a sweet anecdote about their first date is spun into a tale of antilabor scabs totally totally ridiculous  this hillarybashing is really getting embarrassing for the hillaryhaters 
0,really mods  come the fuck on now 
0,i note that bernie sanders has   never   gone on a date with bill clinton 
0,this article reflects the rightwing conspiracy that started 45 years ago to thwart the first woman president from taking office 
0,once again people realize that clicking on an article takes too much work to decide how biased the headline actually is
0,i loathe the clintons with the power of a thousand fiery suns  but i sometimes really appreciate ol  slick willie something else  that s for sure 
0,they grow up so fast 
0,i was told to vote for this woman by my union  iam  but i voted for obama and i will vote for bernie this post leaves a really bad taste in my mouth what hypocrite s they are 
0,good for them  it s pretty amazing that people are upset that the clintons picked up litter that the people who were being paid to do so refused to do  it s like many people always say if they feel the compensation for the job is nt fair  quit and find a job that s more in line with what they feel they should be getting  if they ca nt find a job that pays what they think they are worth  perhaps they are overestimating the value of the skills they bring to the table  i m aware this article was submitted as an attack piece  but the story makes bill clinton look awesome 
0,this is in striking contrast to sanders who got arrested on his college campus for protesting segregation practices 
0,how is that a date   
0,i was taught at a young age  under 10  about not crossing a picket line  but i lived in las vegas with some decent unions would the clinton s have been taught that lesson before they were  20 raised elsewhere in the 60 s 
0,well they do nt have to do that anymore now they ll just get 600k for reading off a speech 
0,scabs  who d imagine that 
0,how the hell is asking for an id a bad thing  this will always confuse me you need an id for pretty much everything 
0,i for one welcome the rise of the green tea party 
0,gt  yeah  i am telling people what they want to hear  people want jobs they want health care they want educational opportunities for their kids they want to deal with climate change they want the wealthiest people to pay their fair share of taxes yeah  that  s what i  m telling people and on every one of those issues  that is exactly what the american people want 
0,to be honest  if the bernie movement can bring as much change to the democratic party as the tea party brought to the gop  i will be happy hate their agenda  but they did drag the gop to the right and got their candidates elected 
0,i just love the fact that bernie is genuinely as frustrated as most people in america 
0,bill  you deregulated wall street and helped directly cause the great recession stfu and stop ruining your legacy 
0,oh boy  bill has lost his mind 
0,smart move by the bernster just respond as if bill clinton is a harmless rambling little man which is what he s becoming  at this point 
0,the tea party was bought openly this movement is nt bought openly  the money is against us openly  this is nt some fairy tale this is a referendum 
0,sometimes  a lot of times actually  i really genuinely think that bernie sanders is a truly honest man  a gifted man  one in a generation that s not to be taken lightly  i really do believe that in my heart of hearts listen to him absolutely shred bill clinton in no uncertain terms i like this man 
0,bill flubbed agin 
0,if he s as nuts as the tea party  why is hillary trying to pretend she shares the same platform 
0,close but no cigar bill
0,billy is so silly 
0,shots fired 
0,the difference between the tea party and feel the bern is that one of these groups can hold down a job 
0,but i thought kashkari was a goldmansachs shill s you can read his full remarks  here   https  wwwminneapolisfedorgnewsandeventspresidentsspeecheslessonsfromthecrisisendingtoobigtofail  gt  i believe we must begin this work now and give serious consideration to a range of options  including the following  breaking up large banks into smaller  less connected  less important entities  turning large banks into public utilities by forcing them to hold so much capital that they virtually can  t fail  with regulation akin to that of a nuclear power plant   taxing leverage throughout the financial system to reduce systemic risks wherever they lie 
0,pretty funny rpolitics is all over kashkari right now  but when he ran as a republican for governor of california back in 2014 he was labeled a shill and considered to be one of the worst men in california 
0,you know sanders campaign is having an effect on this country from top to bottom when headlines like this start popping up try and imagine seeing a headline like this back in 2006  it sounds ridiculous to even think about 
0,oh  so now we re listening to former goldman sachs employees and members of the fed  that s interesting 
0,wanting to place an arbitrary limit on the size of financial institutions is one of the strangest ideas to gain mainstream acceptance in the field of economics  the problem is not that banks are too big  it s that they re too leveraged  given the networking effects involved in finance  having 10 overleveraged small banks may not be any better than having one big overleveraged bank it may actually be easier to regulate and monitor the big one 
0,this is called damage control banks and the fed know reform is coming it s better to control your own fate than let others do it for you 
0,people forget that the federal reserve bank    is not    a government organization it is a privately owned institution it is  the  big bank 
0,he s wrong about  not seeing the next crisis   banks are still selling cdo s and we re due for another housing bubble it wo nt be as bad as the last one due to consumer confidence being low and inhibiting the unbridled optimism that fueled the last one rest assured that we can expect more of the same when the markets correct again
0,there is only one issue i have with what he said and perhaps some on who has a higher degree in economics than i do can explain why i m wrong  i have a minor in economics but does nt increased capital requirements mean banks have much less money to lend thus reducing the amount of money in existence  in economic terms anyway  and thus inflating the value of the dollar  since there is less of it in circulation  causing exports to weaken and imports to strengthen and if my understanding serves one of the problems of the recession was that bank credit simply dried up would nt this idea lead to a similar thing happening  also how small are we talking of making these banks  because economies of scale are still important to keep in mind when redistributing the banking system 
0,this is what they called nationalizing the banks usually we re very clear that we want the government to stay out of our personal finances 
0,he s just pandering nothing to see here
0,someone s feeling the bern
0,he ll either get bribed  assassinated  or threatened and  change  his mind 
0,to all the people saying  how hard it is to get an id  seriously  do a little research into how these states are making it as hard as possible closing down dmvs  requiring a birth certificate  but only the official one  not a copy more forms of id than was needed just a few years ago it s a pain in the ass and poor folks are affected by it a lot more that is entirely the point  you can drive your car and it s totally doable  great  now use public transport to go across town and spend hours at a now overcrowded dmv that has fucky hours that your job is nt friendly about giving you time for  a lot of poor folks get it done  but it fucks up an entire week of getting all the proper shit together it s maddening and it s never been needed before  why now  this research shows you exactly why now  i did nt need a birth certificate when i got my class a licence why did i need it to renew it 
0,i m guessing reddit will also want to hear about how  democrats suppress votes   http  fivethirtyeightcomfeatureshowdemocratssuppressthevote 
0,how  take a look at every other developed countries for example in my country  france  id are free  every small city hall can generate them  employers ca nt refuse their employees to take a day off  paid   to go to their city hall every citizen has one if tomorrow politicians tried to stop the need of a id to vote we would have a new civil war 
0,from the article   richard hasen  professor of law and political science at uc irvine school of law  cautioned against drawing conclusions from the paper  which is an outlier  the authors of the paper also collected no actual data  they just developed a statistical  model  that outputs the desired conclusion  voter id is rayciss   the article itself  is not even published in a peerreviewed journal   http  pagesucsdedu  zhajnalpage5documentsvoteridhajnaletalpdf   meaning it s just more politically motivated academic garbage you can take with a grain of salt 
0,how did nevada take over new mexico  when was this why was this  
0, you mean people did nt know that in 2012 when a republican in pa said this about the voter id laws in the state    https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  euot1brydk8 
0,every other industrialized country and even third world countries require id to vote 
0,how hard is it to get an id 
0,i do nt know about this  honestly  i do nt really think the voter id thing should be a big deal  but there is literally no excuse to not have an id  just no valid excuse  i grew up in severe poverty to a single mother that worked multiple jobs and she still managed to get an id and so did i  you not getting an id is absolutely your own fault  so that is nt really a valid excuse 
0,brilliant episode about voting on last week tonight with jon oliver the best part is at 10  00 when republican lawmakers expose the real intent of voter id laws  http  youtuberhfowlmcdto
0,the big difference here is that one group is using odd year cycles in which voter participation is low to gain an advantage while the other group is limiting voter participation in all elections  in the first case  there s nothing that prevents the electorate from participating in full other than their own apathy in the second  there is a barrier to full participation  there s a distinct difference between using the rules to your advantage and changing the rules to your advantage  edit  the only  legitimate  problem that is solved by voter id laws is voter impersonation one person casting a vote as another  while ostensibly also casting their own vote  there have been fewer than 31 incidents of this type for over 1 billion votes cast   https  wwwwashingtonpostcomnewswonkwp20140806acomprehensiveinvestigationofvoterimpersonationfinds31credibleincidentsoutofonebillionballotscast  so this is a problem that has a 0000000031  impact on our elections but denies the vote to hundreds of thousands of americans 
0,til democrats believe that blacks are to dumb and lazy to get id s 
0,no     sherlock
0,remember everyone  we have a   00000031  rate of voter id fraud   http  wwwwashingtonpostcomnewswonkblogwp20140806acomprehensiveinvestigationofvoterimpersonationfinds31credibleincidentsoutofonebillionballotscast
0,if voting requires an id and you have to pay for that id how is that not a violation of the 24th amendment 
0,there was a fun little experiment done a couple years ago that showed that if you re a state legislator who supports voter id  you ve probably got racial biases in how you respond to your constituents  http  papersssrncomsol3paperscfm  abstract_id  2422596 basically  they sent out identical letters half signed with an anglo sounding name  half with a latino sounding name among legislators that supported voter id  the anglo sounding names were responded to over twice as often as the latino names there was little discrepancy with legislators that did not support voter id laws 
0,if you are an adult and do nt have an id  i m going to assume you re not a very productive member of society  democrats are just angry that voter id hinders their give people a bunch of free shit and bus them to polling stations strategy 
0,does anyone else notice that new mexico is listed as nevada on the map lol
0,i want to know why we do nt start off with  election ink   http  darkroombaltimoresuncomwpcontentuploads20120553afp_getty511140703jpg  nobody can get pissy with that 
0,that s the point 
0,wrote my college thesis on this issue via a case study of indiana vs massachusetts  2014   voter id laws particularly affected hundreds of thousands of hispanics  african americans  women  and elderly wouldbe voters voter id laws also resulted in less than 20 voter fraud convictions takeaway  voter id laws disenfranchise certain groups at an astronomically larger volume than said laws combat voter fraud 
0,why are people trying to remove voter id laws instead of removing the limitations on poor people to get their id s  if you lock yourself out of your car you do nt decide to remove all the locks you keep a spare key somewhere 
0,i find it troubling how partisan the language in the paper s conclusion is at one point  the authors state that  there is a desperate need for hard  empirical evidence  but then go on to say with what seems to be a high degree of confidence that white americans have a growing influence in the political process whereas racial minorities are finding it harder to vote  the fact that this paper is such an outlier when compared to similar studies on the relation between voter id requirements and turnout is concerning when paired with the rhetoric used by the authors of this paper 
0,so organize and get people registered and out to vote they did it in the 1960 s why can not it be done now 
0,well duh  if the repugs are responsible for implementing anything  then by definition it s biased against democrats and minorities the gop  the party of old  rich  white people oh yeah  add in scared to that list 
0,i understand both arguments being made in this thread i think a politically easy solution to solve all of this would be to create an automatic voter registration where every individual can have a voter id shipped to their house when they are 17  to participate in primary if they are 18 by election day   does anyone know how much a federal program like this would cost 
0,why does rpolitics suck europe s dick when it comes to healthcare and taxes but completely ignore the average european reaction to learning that the usa does nt require id to vote 
0,funny  in my poor ass town no one had issues coughing up id when it came time to get booze 
0,no shit
0,when elections teeter on a couple points and billions are spent campaigning  i d think it a pretty easy strategy to go get those people ids 
0,so they do exactly what they were intended to do 
0,id laws also suppress people who need to drive a car  open a bank account  buy booze  rent movies from a store  validate credit card purchases  get a legit job  get married maybe having an id is nt so bad 
0,what is the data on voter fraud  last i heard  there s not much of it at all and that the premise is largely baseless 
0,how the hell is asking for an id a bad thing  this will always confuse me you need an id for pretty much everything 
0,something that applies to everyone equally  is racist   read more about it 
0,by using that logic so does the act of voting itself i ca nt believe they make people get out of their house and go to a place and vote what about people with no legs  what about the people who ca nt read 
0,it s not in the constitution anywhere that says americans are free from having to have documents i think people are imposing liberties that never existed  i think the far left often uses this tactic to fool people in the middle  i do nt see it as unreasonable to actually enforce the law when determining who s running the country i do nt understand why i m supposed to let voter fraud be even a possibility instead  people will claim things like racism  rightwing conspiracy  or something else that convinces me the moderates are being tricked 
0,this just in  water is wet 
0,they re modern day jim crow laws
0,voter fraud is real
0,i d like to know how he intends to cut  860 billion from the budget each year 
0,is there any logical reason to support this  or do cruz supporters just not understand the issues 
0,i make what some would consider  a lot  of money this policy would nt save me enough to make a significant difference in my quality of life  what  would  make a big difference is my country s government going fucking bankrupt 
0,i noticed the  math  is only based on loss of tax revenue  and does nt take into account his proposed spending cuts i feel as though i m missing a good amount of context here 
0,people think trump is an idiot they are wrong he knows exactly what he is doing
0,make no mistake donald trump knows exactly what he s doing 
0,the things donald trump says are starting to make sense to me call 911  i must be having a stroke 
0,i dont like trump and i would nt vote for him but i do kind of see why people would vote for him he does nt let people push him around  he kicked out that one blm protester for example and i i dont know if any other candidate would do that i guess he speaks to a lot of peoples frustrations 
0,pretty sure it was a lot more than 7 times 
0,lol that last sentence
0,i do like him trashing gwb in south carolina the bush bros deserve that after the bs that they have done 
0,it just proves the media establishment says most what they would  wish  would happen

0,since the last cnnorc poll of sc  taken in october    hillary has gained 7 points  from 49 to 56    bernie has gained 20 points  from 18 to 38   edit  typo
0,40  of those polled are still undecided  sc will be a lot closer than nh was 
0,bernie needs to win nevada 
0,better than a 40 or 50 point lead like a month ago she s dropping fast  poll has an a on 538
0,looks like clinton is doing well in states that wo nt vote democrat in the general election 
0,after living in south carolina for a year and keeping in touch with people there  i would nt be ecstatic about this if i were a clinton supporter maybe  i d stick with  clinton is favored by 18 points in  a state    i ve got no hate for sc but  let s be honest  even the progressives there average about 30 years behind the curve of liberal culture 
0,only 40  of likely democratic voters have decided who they are voting for though and only 34  of likely black voters have decided i think that bodes well for bernie who has a much better ground game  source  http  wwwcnncom20160216politicssouthcarolinapollcnnorcindexhtml the part i referred to is near the bottom
0,not too terrible considering clinton was expecting to crush sanders into the dirt in sc just a few weeks ago  sc might actually be a nail biter if he keeps gaining 
0,and this is where clinton is supposed to be strongest  she s plummeted the last 2 months in sc
0,the outcome in nevada will weigh heavily on those who have not decided  about a third of black voters  34   say they have decided on a candidate versus nearly 6 in 10 white voters  57      http  wwwcnncom20160216politicssouthcarolinapollcnnorcindexhtml 
0,i need something explained to me from people in the know  why is sander s support so low among blacks  he has been a civil rights activist for as long as we can find records of him has marched with civil rights leaders of the day has been consistent on all of his platforms  what do blacksminorities know that i do not  where should i be looking for stories to explain this  i need some sources on this please i ca nt find sources to adequately explain this to me 
0,hillary s campaign is essentially 3 vs 1  bill and chelsea are continuously sent out to do hillary s dirty work  sanders campaign can rebuff bill  but rebuffing chelsea would undoubtedly result in the clintons labelling him a sexist creeper  luckily they ve been smart enough to avoid that trap 
0,6point margin of error  jesus 
0,a lot of undecided voter will play an advantage to bernie
0,this lead will vanish in exit polls mark my words 
0,call the grounds crew  cause team hilary s moving the goalposts
0,why do we care so much about sc  when was the last time a democrat won sc in the general election 
0,victory   
0,her lead is shrinking every day she will be crushed when it comes time for south carolina they re only a few more days and he is slowly slowly coming up on her i think her campaign is in shambles right now and they re really feeling it we re going to see who the true nominee will be clinton is no queen but we are going to see who s going to be crowned king and i will be bernie sanders he is going to be reckoning that this country needs 
0,why pollsters assume a youge black turnout  according to cnn poll  hillary leading among blacks  6528  meanwhile bernie leads among whites  5440   overall result is 5638  so if turnout ratio is 5050 hillary should lead by 65 points  52546   why in the earth black folks will turnout for hillary more than they did for obama back in 2008 primaries
0,clinton is an unethical fraudster fact 
0,not to say this is nt a good result for hillary it is but the trendlines have got to be worrying for her campaign she had a 31 point lead in october and now it s down to 18 points 40  of democratic voters are still trying to decide  so there s room for a potentially big swing  hillary will very likely win sc but the question is by how much i m expecting a low to mid double digit win for her at this point if sanders can hold her to single digits in sc  that will be big 
0,the number of hillary canvassers positively dwarfs the number of sanders canvassers bernie s online support does nt stretch out to the real world
0,gt  trump not only pointed out that bush was president on 911 and that the attacks that day count toward his final grade  but he also noted that bush failed to heed intelligence warnings about the pending attack and that his administration lied to the public about weapons of mass destruction in iraq  all of which is common knowledge to the rest of us  but republican political orthodoxy forbids these things from being mentioned aloud trump is just being true to his distaste for political correctness 
0,note  article title is irony
0,pfffffffft    what a maroon  s

0,15 years later  seems obvious that they let 911 happen to pursue their agenda and military goals  or i am insane  i guess and it s all just coincidence

0,all this is doing is encouraging simpleminded trump supporters to attack protestors in the hopes they ll get the opportunity to meet their phony hero i ca nt wait to watch trump get trounced in the general  fueled specifically by votes from the very people he denigrates 
0,holy shit take that tobacco out of your mouth when you speak

0,really the clinton campaign  does nt  have the funds first  they spend 3040  on polling alone second  their base cost for their expansive campaign  salaries  daily promotionals  etc  is really high that s like another 30   now consider that something like 65  of their donors are already maxed outso there s no returning to the well there she has a cash flow problem  which is why she s starting to draw the superpac money into the race 
0,just some stuff about priorities usa action  1  the article identifies it as  hillary clinton s superpac  but that s not really that accurate they support clinton now  but they were setup as barack obama s  official  superpac for the 2012 election establishment gon na establish  2  superpacs do have to disclose donors   here s 2012 for obama   https  wwwopensecretsorgpacspacgave2php  cmte  c00495861amp  cycle  2012    here s 2016 for hillary   https  wwwopensecretsorgpacspacgave2php  cmte  c00495861amp  cycle  2016   big donors are mostly hollywood execs  soros gave a lot though he always does  then it s a pretty diverse mix  it s not like it says  goldman sachs  all the way down  however yeah it s fair to say  100000 donations aint coming from the middle class  not really trying to take a position  just wanted to share facts i thought pertinent 
0,if the campaigns are nt allowed to coordinate with the super pacs  then how could clinton even tell them to stop advertising

0,of course he will  anything else wold be pointless  stupid and a waste of everyone s time  bu the republicans will still block whoever it is anyway  no matter how qualified they may be
0, me      republican heads explode    
0,as i posted on a different thread  i can not recall  or google  a supreme court candidate being nominated twice hence  if the senate is sincere about rejecting any and all nominees then whoever obama puts forward will be sacrificed it makes for an interesting decision in the white house  nominate the most appropriatedeserving and potentially lose them forever  or nominate a second tier candidate 
0,well  good it would be awful if you nominated someone who was nt qualified

0,if the teachers union did a better job  then they would nt have to make the government force people to be members this means they have zero accountability to their members  which leads to the kind of teachers union waste and corruption we have here in chicago

0,uh  why is this  sorry hillary   the conventional wisdom is that sanders has a more narrow support base  right 
0,this is a horrible article  but interesting fact i was unaware of  here in vegas  whites are the minorityso i guess this was the point it was trying to make  idk 
0,what a shit article

0,reno nevada is a lot like vegas but  but with more meth use and higher minimum wages seriously  the city is so diverse we put the biggest in our people and little in our wieners if you think reno just a joke than you should probably take down to mexico i bet you did nt know that reno is reindeer in spanish and if you try to leave us you just might vanish reno is like a monkey going branch to branch one second you re here and then at mustang ranch at that ranch there s really no horses just a lot of men with a lot of divorces  i do nt think anyone who is from nevada will read this article and take much away from it 
0,also a divorce state  ok  i ll show myself out  but as op i think you have to cut me some slack 
0,we are even i m shrugging off hillary 
0,this is what makes me think her supporters are so gullible she s playing them like a trumpet and they still defend her like she s the moral  pragmatic choice good luck 
0,well  to be fair  those fees are just a drop in the bucket when you consider the clintons  massive haul
0,does anyone believe that hilary clinton was not going to run for president 
0,let s talk about how secretary of state was too much for her and had her contemplating leaving politics multiple times 
0,staaahhhhhp
0,does nt this simply show that people are willing to pay a lot of money to hear hillary s views  and that wall street has a lot of respect for her global perspective  regardless of her policy proposals   i know it s easy to paint her as prowall street for this  but getting paid for a speech is far from lobbying for wall street or being  bought and paid for  anyone familiar with her platform would know that  i would be more skeptical if she spoke for free 
0,he may win right there  but will that end racism  will that end sexism 
0,its true  i bet we got more ground game than hillary  when i attended a volunteer seminar recently we had lots of volunteers and almost all of them had never volunteered for a political campaign before  myself included

0,what happens when everybody figures out the banks are not the economy 
0,the  revolution  is real it s a rejection of globalist neoconservatism  being  policeman of the world   supporting us global hegemony at all costs i have bad news for bernie supporters  the revolution also rejects the agenda of the  globalist left  as well  through overwhelming public support for shutting down illegal immigration and curtailing legal immigration as well for years and years  the globalist left s political strategy has been to import thirdworld voters who support their agenda and do everything in their power to make sure they vote  reject voterid laws  bus people to polls  advocate compulsory voting  and even complain about how nebulous  oppression  causes disenfranchisement rather than pure apathy and lack of agency 
0,it s been a talking point so testing companies can make money it s also an aspect of dog whistle politics and implicitly and explicitly divisive  it encourages an  us vs them  towards people who are struggling 
0,just a thought  is nt it possible that welfare recipients who otherwise would have used drugs decided not to because their benefits depended on it  i m not saying drug testing welfare recipients is a good thing  but i m also skeptical that this proves welfare recipients use drugs at a significantly lower rate than the national average 
0,the fact that senate republicans will attempt to block an obama nominee is no surprise what is surprising is the assertion that he should nt even attempt to replace justice scalia  even though he has nearly a year left in office it s as though somehow that would be unseemly to leave the supreme court without a tie breaking vote until 2017 is not in the best interest of the country 
0,this is literally one of the things i specifically voted for 
0,gt  senate inaction likely means the court will be without one justice for two terms the next supreme court term will be nearly half over when the next president is sworn in  and even if that president nominates quickly  confirmation is unlikely before the term  s end that means two years of potential 44 deadlocks that leave the court unable to decide major constitutional issues thus refusing to even vote on a nominee is not just an abdication of constitutional duty  it will manufacture a constitutional crisis  this should be the lede senate inaction could split the court 44 for the 20152016 term and the 20162017 term sitting on this nomination means it ll be   october of 2018   before the court opens a term with a full bench 
0,minor point but is nt this incorrect  gt  scalia is the first supreme court justice to die midterm since robert jackson in 1954 rehnquist died on the bench in 2005 
0,reps are inna pickle  they either scorch earth obama s pick and bet they get the wh next year  or hedge and comprimise on a moderate obama may slip a more moderate person in if they hedge their bets  but where it s going either  next dem inserts way more liberal that obamas pick or  r  win the wh and can put a conservative judge in  but that is in turn  betting on trump s continued koolaid wallsmashing rise to the presidency  so i got ta ask em do you feel lucky 
0,if the late justice had died on january 15th of next year  ok  they might have a point at that point it s a week until inauguration  nothing s going to get done in that time  but it would be classy to consult with his successor to get the process started a week sooner  but cmon guysinauguration is 11 12 months away insisting on it now is just plain childish 
0,appoint and nominate do nt mean the same thing 
0,regardless of your liberalconservative views  one of the main reasons supreme court justices have lifetime appointments is so that they may adjudicate  free from political influence this whole debate that is currently raging was never supposed to have occurred in the first place as the nominee is supposed to be someone who is the most qualified for the job in both the eyes of the president and the senate conservative or liberal  it was nt supposed to matter 
0,suppose that the gop wins the presidency but the democrats recapture the senate does anyone really think that if the democrats vote down every nominee for 4 years that the republicans will just say   well  that s just the senate doing their constitutional duty to advise and consent boy this is hard  i hope we can find a reasonable agreement on a suitable replacement   hell no  they would rage out  part of why our political system mostly works in this country is that for over 200 years even bitter rivals have been able to act in a manner which reflects respect for civic duty when that broke down once before  more than 600000 people died to resolve the dispute  if the senate does nt consider nominees to the supreme court in good faith  they risk the entire political system crashing down civil wars have been fought over less than this 
0,whether or not you are a fan of president obama  it is his responsibility to present a nominee to fill the vacancy a full year without even a name provided would be gross negligence on his part  imho there are good  qualified candidates for the position and there are issues that need to be adjudicated without danger of a 44 nondecision

0,if she did nt know her husband had a loose cannon by now  there s just no excuse 
0,the  mixed race  comment is odd but not completely out of line  notwithstanding the criticism of the random  democratic blogger  they quoted more damaging is probably his claim that hillary clinton is a  changemaker  who can get things done where president obama could not  for two primary reasons  1 anything that she can accomplish with an overwhelmingly republican congress will come at the expense of the voters she is courting in the democratic primary  2 it illustrates an undeserved smugness as well as disdain for president obama s accomplishments it also demonstrates that her attack on senator sanders for being insufficiently supportive of the president is disingenuous political theater 
0,gt  in response  aaron camp  a democratic blogger  wrote   for  mr clinton  to claim that we are all mixed race people    is dismissive of the serious problem of racism and racial inequality in this country  and  as a matter of fact  racist  valid point but i could nt care less what a  blogger  has to say 
0,so much innuendo so little facts why so coy  if you got something tell us this article is almost meta it s an article about how the writer might go get the sources and facts needed to write an actual article 
0,what a ridiculous piece of agitprop how hard have republicans tried over the years to get one of these laughable scandals to stick  i d at least like to see some originality this time around remember when she was accused of murdering vince foster  then when the obvious lack of evidence became undeniable it simply became another part of the elaborate conspiracy what is more believable  that no plausible reason for indictment exists or hilary is some kind of cartoonish supervillain who acts with impunity and controls the free world from the shadows  if you believe the latter  please also explain why she would want to run for president since she obviously has everything figured out already 
0,man the ny post really has it in for hillary 
0,it s the post never trust the post i do nt even like hillary clinton  but if you guys are at the point where the new york post  a murdoch owned tabloid  is considered a legitimate news source on clinton then there is something seriously wrong with you guys they ve been publishing unsubstantiated hit pieces against her for over 20 years  they are nt exactly unbiased

0,republicans were saying this about whitewater and cattle futures and travelgate over 20 years ago 
0,berine supporter here just came in to say   ny post  lol 
0,lolor it might just mean that  despite a concerted effort for 30 years to connect her from everything from murder to drug running  these are nt real issues 
0,it  might  also be reasonable to conclude that her not having been indicted is a sign she has nt broken any laws  you know  if you re posting fox news and ny post articles in support of your cause  it might be time to evaluate your course 
0,uhh i have a great idea  let s get ken starr back and give him unlimited power and tons of money to investigate endlessly and if he takes long enough maybe she will get caught having sex with an intern and all the little trolls can say  see i told you so  we always knew she did something  we just had to wait long enough for her to actually do it  gotcha  she s not my first choice for president but if she s so damn good at getting away with all the stuff she s been accused of for 30 years  then maybe she d make a tough and crafty president  in her absence i would nominate the following paragons of virtue  bob livingston  tom delay denny hastert scooter libby newt gingrich irancontra etcetc  yo investigate this  shit happens on both sides of the aisle but since the day bill clinton announced his first run for president  the republicans have redefined the term  witch hunt  if they were half as obsessive about fixing things  we d all be living in the  real  america we all deserve

0,i ca nt pinpoint if but something looks different about herhttp  imgurcomkqgo1jr
0,maybe the author of this article could show an example of a crime worthy of indictment  and why hillary was nt prosecuted for it  seems to me there s ample political will to prosecute the clinton s for any wrongdoing from the right  so if there s sufficient evidence out there  why is nt it being acted upon  just reporting that other people say there s wrongdoing worthy of prosecution is nt  evidence  of anything other than what that person claimed if ken starr has evidence that a crime was committed twenty years ago  what s he been waiting for

0,that s fing ridiculous usa is one of the few countries in the world where our underprivileged children have an inordinately high  obesity  rate 
0,what are you doing  bill  
0,i support sanders and it s a valid comparison they are both grassroots movements driven by frustration with the party establishment which are trying to steer the party to a less watered down version of what it claims to support they both have a more raw presentation which ignores the unspoken rules of what is okay to talk about they obviously have differences but from the high level  they are similar 
0,in fairness  before the tea party was coopted by fox news and freedomworks  it actually did have a legitimate grassroots origin which was born of   some   of the similar frustrations that sander s supporters are expressing now in this way the origins are not entirely dissimilar  what   i   think is amusing is that bill clinton is trying to smear sanders by comparing his supporters to a  successful  movement much as people may hate to admit it  the tea party completely changed the political landscape  and not just in dc  so i think the message is clear  folks former president bill clinton is telling sanders supporters that they too can change the entire political landscape   billisaberniebro
0,i do nt think that denigrating sanders supporters will prove to be a winning move for the clintons if hillary s supporters had half the passion as they do her campaign probably would nt be so nervous  in reality  i see huge differences between the sanders movement and the tea party the tea party was manufactured by fox news and freedomworks to serve the establishment s purpose whereas the sanders movement is a true grassroots movement against politics as usual night and day difference 
0,gt  he added that the democratic party is experiencing a pull to the left similar to the extreme right pull exerted on the republican party by the tea party  the irony is that the dnc pulled hard to the right beginning with his second term if anything  i see this is a selfcorrection  in fairness  he never said that sanders supporters are like the tea party  but he did make allusions to that effect  and  before i am blasted  i m a sanders supporter 
0,i know its intended to be a jab  but the tea party has been very effective at getting their vocal minority into a number of local and state positions 
0,more and more  i wonder if bill is not looking forward to living in the white house again  especially if he does nt get to have the oval office  he s been doing his  open mouth  insert foot  routine for a few days now 
0,they say things like this because they are desperate to hold power attack  attack  attack desperate that is the clinton way it s disturbing that anyone would support this family people that desperate for power should never be allowed to have it i ve asked people to explain why they support hillary the answer  because republicans that s it bernie is simply a superior candidate in the face of that truth  you attack and hope something sticks may the entire clinton family fade to a footnote 
0,thanks for lumping me in with the sarah palinmichelle bachmannted cruz sycophants bill 
0,also had interesting words to say about obama in 2008  gt   a few years ago  this guy would have been carrying our bags 
0,i m surprised people are arguing with this  i would ve thought the similarities to the tea party were obvious if anything  bernie is turning out to be more successful than the tea partiers were  he is challenging the party establishment  claiming that they are not representing the interests of a big portion of their constituents  and calling for change their tactics are pretty much the same  only the issues are different 
0,solid move  if your intention is to fuck up at everything 
0,he s not wrong the tea party movement was pretty successful and put people in office 
0,bill clinton started us out on the proverbial road to ruin with his thirdway  republicanlite shit policies  and now his wife wants to finish the job no thanks 
0,fair comparison  bernie supporters are very grass roots  however  i would say they are the antitea party 
0,now now bill  i have nt seen a sanders supporter with  a factually contradictory sign that betrays their lack of understanding of the issues   https  wwwgooglecomsearch  q  keepgovernmentoutofmymedicareamp  biw  1390amp  bih  770amp  source  lnmsamp  tbm  ischamp  sa  xamp  sqi  2amp  ved  0ahukewixiyr12_zkahvesimkhbilacgq_auibigb 
0,he s not wrong just because his last name is clinton  guys  he s 100  right this is absolutely the left s tea party moment 
0,the clintons are berning down their own campaign 
0,the ironic thing is that the democratic party could benefit from having a radical  do this or be primaried  movement willing to push the party to the left and allow the moderates to say  i would pact with you but those crazy people would eat my liver   in parlamentary systems the comunistgreenleftlibertarian parties are the ones doing pushing so the democratic socialist and liberal parties remain honest  it is heartbreaking that the husband of a  progressive  sees the progresive wing of his own party as the enemy  since hillary and bernie  agree  on so many things it must be so hard for her 
0,good at least _someone_ seems to see what s happening  shape up or be fractured  dnc 
0,in a way  bernie supporters are like the tea party citizens who are fed up with status quo party politics organizing to elect individuals that will change their party the difference is ideology 
0,he s not wrong half the people on this subreddit list trump as their second choice for president 
0,this is just crazy  bernie fans are ideological purists  fighting against a democrat in name only  dino   and trying to purge the establishment from dc  the tea party are ideological purists  fighting against a republican in name only  rino   and trying to purge the establishment from dc  big difference 
0,let me say that i certainly hope so  the tea party has completely taken over control of the gop to such an extent that the party establishment can no longer dictate to them with absolute authority  let s also take a moment to remind everyone that the tea party during it s inception was made and built by ron paul and his supporters it was nt until later that the movement was hijacked by a torrent of koch money and became simply an outcry of  boo obama   seeing as bernie s army puts corrupting money at spot  1 as far as problems go that s one we likely wo nt see 
0,whatever anyone thinks of the tea party  it s a simple fact that they ve done a decent job wresting control of their party back from the entrenched corporate interests that were attempting to dominate it or at least they were  and even now there s a weird combination of uneasy alliance vs power struggle going on  if we can do the same on the left  i ll be very happy 
0,i mean  we are both interested in politics i guess 
0,he is correct  in that the fact the tea party was a republican cashroots campaign that took over and radicalized republicans and got them participating in government if this is somehow a bad thing for democrats to emulate then i missed the memo stating the government is a representation of corporate interests and not a representation of the peoples interests  edited for clarity 
0,damnit bill  i thought we were cool 
0,bill is gon na hand this election to bernie 
0,well then it would be wise for democrats to fall in line would nt it  the tea party cost several representatives their jobs and fractured the republican party beyond repair  of course the tea party is just a front for monied interests to cripple the federal government  but i think my point still kind of stands 
0,the clintons seems to think that it matter more that you get something done no matter what the consequences are than to be principled and not pass conservative legislation for the republicans 
0,i make a point to never take anything a serial rapist says seriously  nypd detectiveretired  
0,man  i used to like bill 
0,as a bernie supporter  there s some truth to that  the most rabid of us seem to not give a shit that they re using right wing attack fodder so long as it helps bernie all in the name of  fuck the system   the narrative is in fact being played by the system  it s disheartening really 
0,i compare clinton supporters to republicans like jeb 
0,theres no way thats going to turn voters off of hillary 
0,the tp was and still is a minority of the republican party progressives are damn near half of the democratic party the tp was and still is a group of know nothing bigots who were pissed an african american democrat was elected president their campaign was to take their country backfrom negros and to give every man  woman and child a gun progressives have real issues they stand behind that actually have a real impact on most americans  both financially and socially bill  if you treat us like the tp  we wo nt vote for you it gets worse though many others will be motivated to campaign actively against you you have made a grave mistake unfortunately  by the time your stuck in the 90 s campaign figures it out  it will be to late 
0,at least we do nt betray others 
0,they re literally doing the same shit as in 2008  like they thought obama must have been a fluke and it ll work this time obama was an approaching wave  and it s beginning to crest nothing will stop it  only slow it down  simply because time keeps on going forward and there s a whole generation or two that has more of it left on their side than the other generations do 
0,bill  why are you making me dislike you   why  i always liked bill clinton  thought he was a pretty good president how are comments like this supposed to make me feel 
0,nice try bill  maybe tomorrow s spitball claim will actually stick 
0,he is nt wrong bernie supporters often accuse her of not being a  true progressive   similar to how tea partiers primaried conservatives who they thought were rinos despite agreeing with them on most issues 
0,as far as i can tell they have nt been coopted by billionaires intent on fucking up america just yet 
0,bernie sanders supporters are increasingly becoming a liberal tea party a section of the democratic party unrelenting in its  extreme  principles  complete distrust of the current establishment  and a set of policy proposals which are outside the main stream of the democratic party  e  while bill clinton is trying to smear bernie sanders supporters i m not i just think he happens to be right whether that means sanders  unelectable  or if this is even a concern for his campaign remains to be seen 
0,it s the  third way  centrist obstructionists that impede progress they are those chanting  no we ca nt 
0,bernie sanders is no tea party insurrection 
0,we can both play this game  i suppose  bill clinton is a rapist  see  hurling shit at a wall until it sticks is fun 
0,this is what happens when you ca nt provide one simple  nonfluffy reason as to why you re running for president 
0,bill  you are making a fool of yourself 
0,as if i needed another reason to vote for anyone but hrc in the event bernie does nt win 
0,i did nt think it was possible  but i have less respect for bill with every detrimental comment he spews about bernie and his supporters he should realize he s going to need us if hillary somehow wins the nomination
0,go back to getting your dick sucked  bill
0,okay  bill clinton has jumped the fucking shark 
0,anybody who says  well i guess bills kind of right  the two movements are kind of similar in some respects  is missing the point  while bill is correct hes only trying to make a loaded point in an attempt to discredit the sanders campaign it s transparent rhetoric meant to create a negative association this is alarming because not only is it yet another black mark on clintons unethical campaign and persona  its just stupid politics it alienates voters and further divides a party that wants to win the general incompetence of this level does nt deserve to be rewarded in the internet age 
0,bill is shocked that progressives are trying to pull the democratic party back to the left after him and his third way democrats pulled it to the right  shocker 
0,bill  do yourself a favor  go ask your current intern for teabag 
0,ok  that s it  fuck this guy 
0,i might be going out on a limb here but maybe  just maaaaybe i am guessing that not many trump supporters are fond of obama so this will only be fuel for the donald to use in his next rally speech 
0,i think obama knows that there are a significant numbers of republicans that disagree with everything he says  and will thus continue to support trump  from the democrats  perspective  trump is the best gop candidate in the field because he is a wildcard and does nt follow the party line additionally  trump is not afraid to call out the gop s bullshit  even if trump does nt win the nomination  the longer he stays in  the more likely he is to damage the other candidates and the more likely he is to go 3rd party  obama plays chess the gop plays checkers 
0,this comment made by obama will only help trump because it elevated him above all the other opponents in south carolina obama basically recognized him as a front runner by making this statement 
0,what a great endorsement for trump bush and now obama attacking him just cements him as antiestablishment 
0, who s the president of the united states    ronald reagan   hah  an actor  then who s the vice president  jerry lewis  
0,let s be honest  it s george w could do it  anyone can do it 
0,meanwhile hillary makes barking noises on camera 
0,there s nothing you can do about that lol
0,obama can be pretty savage 
0,funny considering between obama and trump  trump is the only one that has ever actually created a  serious job  or held one 
0,has obama ever even had a private sector job in his life 
0,why do pundits still say trump is nt  serious   trump clearly stands to benefit by winning  both in terms of his net assets and in terms of political power and prestige 
0,yep very serious you literally have to cry on camera to regain your failing support as president  obama just made trump the candidate probably will go up 5  in polls 10  nationally  thank you so much mr obama   yeah  i remember your campaign also mr obama  hope and change  marketing and selling but oh waityou also say that trump is just a great marketershow i dont understand mr obama  are you just a hypocrite  or a bit ignorant  or are you just being a political liar  i thank the sweet baby jesus obama just made trump the candidate because republicans dont like obama and many democrats also dont like obama blacks dont like obama  lol  now you bernie supporters just pray he keeps on kissing the bum of hillary 
0,i see what you did there barack  well played  well played 
0,has trump called him a stupid poopyhead yet 
0,it s pretty likely the gop will have trump as their candidate  and wwwfivethirtyeightcom have been saying so for a while  however  the dems should be peachy so long as they do nt have a farleft extremist as their candidate oh  wait

0,yep  the constitution is clear  the president nominates people  senate has to approve them if they ca nt agree  no progress is made why are both sides having such a struggle with this 
0,interesting look at history  kerry on his filibuster http  wwwnytimescom20060127politicspoliticsspecial127alitohtml gt   people can say all they want that elections have consequences   he wrote  trust me  more than anyone i understand that but that seems like an awfully convoluted rationale for me to stay silent about judge alito s nomination  gt   the president has every right to nominate samuel alito to the supreme court   mr kerry said  it s our right and our responsibility to oppose him vigorously 
0,gt  when asked by a reporter about his own support of a filibuster of justice samuel alito  then a nominee of president george w bush  obama shot back that  justice alito is on the bench right now  so its okay because he ultimately failed got it 
0,obama only follows the constitution when it suits him 
0,hey the constitution is  pretty clear  on gun rights and the right to privacy but i guess those slipped by him

0,is he going to enforce the laws on the books and deport all those illegals  did nt think so 
0,nevada also sabotaged america s nuclear industry harry ried worked very hard to stall the yucca mtn nuclear waste depository for the past decade the result is that states heavily reliant on nuclear power  mostly in the south  get screwed as they have to pay more for waste storage  ultimately nevada is run by clarke co and voters there decided two things  that they did nt want tax money to go towards solar rebates and that they did nt want nuclear waste storage site way up in yucca mtn

0,actually  i think she did nt run  because he is they re definitely similar  and i would like to see her do big things in years to come i think they re paving the way for each other to make revolutionary changes she makes me so proud to be form massachusetts 
0,i dislike salon but damn that s a fair  great piece 
0,well  it looks like hillary1000 is due for a software update 
0,that reads like a proclinton push poll it did nt even ask about which candidate they d support  luckily it was nt a telephone survey  although pushpolling by telephone is also a thing  it s taking things pretty far  even for an unscientific survey  gt  1  sanders could be elected as president in november  as americans reject concerns over his identity as a  democratic socialist  okay  strong opening  gt  2  clinton is a betterqualified candidate because of her experience as the wife of a president  a senator and secretary of state  oh dear  if you were expecting a question here also regaling sanders  past career and marital status  you d be mistaken  gt  3  both candidates are actively vying for the votes of africanamericans those voters have better reasons to support  okay  without controlling for demographics  this does nt mean _anything_ gt  4  it is important to me that clinton be elected this year as the first woman president in us history  oh my 
0,sometimes  deficit spending is a democratic socialist 
0,sanders straight up said that if warren does nt run  or another progressive  that he would run no one stepped into the race so he did 
0,and i think 99  of bernie sanders  supporters would be just as happy  if not happier  with warren 
0,i believe they probably have discussed this between the two of them and decided that bernie would run for whatever reasons 
0,most bernie supporters wanted her first it is not that they do nt want hillary because she is a woman  they do nt want her because she is calculating rather than principled  opportunistic as opposed to moral 
0,he s going to make her secretary of the treasury  hopefully 
0,if sanders loses this election  she will win in 2020 by a 51 margin 
0,if she ran she would have won 
0,please give bernie some credit for daring this  radical  campaign   i do nt think it was an battle to lose to begin with and it is nt now i admire his courage more 
0,i knew and loved warren before i ever heard of sanders  but i think he has a better chance than warren would ve while he has the age and jewish thing against him  warren has almost no history in politics compared to clinton  elected to senate in 2013  and the difference would ve been far starker 
0,actually  i think she did nt run  because he is they re definitely similar  and i would like to see her do big things in years to come i think they re paving the way for each other to make revolutionary changes she makes me so proud to be form massachusetts 
0,warren is most effective in the senate 
0,i love warren for the same reason i love sandersunvarnished straight talk that is both believable and not self serving both of them are people i would want to be friends with because i feel i could call them when facing a difficult decision or moral dilemma and get some advice that would likely solve the problem  i feel that clinton would give me advice she could either profit from or use against me in the future 
0,sanderswarren 2016 
0,i m not sure she would have a chance against clinton though the reason bernie has been so effective is because of his recordrhetoric she does nt have the record 
0, great men do not seek power they have power thrust upon them 
0,please  please  i beseech you all  stop with the vp talk it will not happen and should not happen warren far more valuable and powerful in the senate 
0,alright  i got ta jump in here i know that most of reddit absolutely loves warren  but she is just as big of a politico as clinton or rubio i m from a small suburb of boston  and i guarantee if you mentioned it to her  she would nt know where it is she does nt do much  in my opinion  for the commonwealth she represents  opting instead to work for national causes  she s a carpet bagging technocrat from harvard law who was crowned  just like clinton  by the dnc amp  dccc to take ted kennedy s seat back from scott brown  who won it by beating the last anointed ma senate candidate  martha coakley  who was acting like hrc is now when she was campaigning  like she inherited the job   i know on the national stage she is a progressive hero  but as somebody she is supposed to represent right now  i feel that she is using massachusetts like so many other aspirational politicians  patrick  romney  brown  callahan  etc   stepping on our heads on the way to dc 
0,warren for vp 
0,i m really hoping sanders picks her as a running mate  if she d accept   she s a fabulous politician though having her in the senate may allow her to affect more 
0,warren for vp  sanders  warren 2016
0,if he would pick her for vp i d lose it that s the dream team 
0,could there be a sanderswarren ticket 
0,was nt sanders recruited to run by the people who started the draft warren group after she firmly declined to run 
0,i would bet that if bernie wins the nomination warren will be top choice for vpgiven bernie s age it would be a coup if she accepted 
0,i identify as a pretty middleoftheroad independent  socially liberal  fiscally conservative  and i d feel a hell of a lot better voting for warren than sanders 
0,in what world does clinton s remark at the end make sense  you ca nt criticise the current president because you re in the same party  does she really expect that kind of partisanship  does she think it s a good thing 
0,bernie is only running because elizabeth did nt 
0,i have nt looked in a while but it seems as these two are very compatible as politicians maybe they could go as running mates 
0,ever consider that maybe elizabeth warren did nt run because bernie was going to run 
0, if thing that did not happen had happened  then other thing that did happen might not have happened  great reporting 
0,i recall bill maher offering her 1 million dollars if she ran 
0,sometimes  deficit spending is a democratic socialist 
0,i thought the bill press interview was super interesting is it possible to get a link for the full version 
0,she might get nominated for the scotus vacancy 
0,there were a ton of people who should have run  but did nt bother because the process seemed set up for hillary to win who saw kerryedwards coming in 2004  historically way more people on both sides have been willing to give it a shot and see how it goes  turning the nominating process into hillary s coronation was a huge mistake 
0,i was all in for warren  signed the petition to ask her to run she said no and we got bernie happy with either one
0,elizabeth warren is the goldman sach s wolf in sheep s clothing do nt buy into her bullshit 
0,i ve been a bernie fan since he arrived in congress in 1991 but i would have been perfectly happy with warren as a candidate she s better known and bernie did not want to run i listened to the onceaweek brunch with bernie hour on the thom hartmann radio show and bernie kept hoping a progressive like warren would run when no one came forward  he began talking about running himself 
0,so sanders runs because he feels he must  that the country needs his policies and pretty much every other candidate in either party runs because of personal ambition 
0,what s sad is that the damage the lead poisoning causes is nt really treatable i ve heard that they can kind of remove the lead from a person s body  but the brain damage is irreversible forgot to mention that the damage is done mostly to children  because it stops their brain from developing properly  i first heard about it on npr  it was  this   http  wwwnprorg20160122463929541leadpoisoningdatesbacktoromantimes  interview  this   http  wwwnprorg20151018449747061lessonsfromafighttofixflintswatersupply  one is also pretty good 
0,the comments from the parent about the decline in their child s ability to focus and do their schoolwork was heartbreaking  the fact is that the local and state government decided to turn their heads how much did the federal government know  and how long ago  all these government officials turning their heads and acting like this whole situation is frightening to say the least why did they do it  special interests  lobbyists  was it because the majority of the community was poor and they figured nobody would care  was it racially motivated  all of the above  one has to wonder if this is happening elsewhere in the us these political officials do nt give a rat s ass about communities that do nt contribute to their campaigns  it s time for a change 
0,episode 7 of cosmos  2014  exposes the detrimental effects of lead on humans especially children house are condemn for having lead paint and here we have whole city s water system contaminated by lead and the officials stick their heads in the sand someone needs to be charged with a crime 
0,not to mention flint is in a state surrounded by fresh water 
0,that s what happens when you do nt invest in infrastructure because you think government projects are a waste of money people used to understand that if you do nt fund public works nothing works for the public 
0,is nt it weird what happens when nobody votes in elections  stuff just kinda  falls apart  just sayin
0,i attended this rally today bernie was dead on in his statements regarding flint  and america s larger problems with infrastructure and crumbling  decrepit inner cities i especially liked his proposal to employ jobless americans to repair america s failing public works

0, your town is a shithole   crowd cheers 
0,too bad sanders is nt part of the legislative branch  then he just might be in a position to do something about it 
0,it is  after all  the present year 
0,im a sanders supporter and the 1st thing i thought of was the communities response when hillary did this  my question is with all his talk wtf is bernie going to do right now not when he wins but right now  if he just talks about it honestly hes no better than hillary
0,i like how when sanders does something it s good and totally not for political reasons however  when clinton does something it s a political side show and she is only doing it to get votes 
0,i mean cmon ppl its 2016
0,well sanders  the predominant areas are all in cities controlled by one party and controlled by that same party for decades it is a real shame but it never came to light until they could try and pin it on a republican during an election cycle
0,and they knew  all the way up to the federal epa for months without telling people they were drinking poisoned water they took this time to argue over who s fault it was rather than to come up with a fix  this is nt a failure or one city or one state  it is a failure of government 
0,he s meeting with them now and he did nt know  has nt this been going on for a while 
0,got it hillary goes to flint  to see the people and condemms the situation vote grabbing just trying to get the checkoff for minorities and articles calling her out saying it was for other reasons sanders goes to flint  because he s a great man and condemms the situation  goodness out of his own heart and ttly not related to his political aspirations 
0,think how much  and of importance  will be  how much of flint  michigan s future has already been washed away with poisoned water a generation of young people whose potential has been capped by a lead ceiling they will struggle against for the rest of their lives are we not already engaged in a civil war  of which this is but one of many similar conflicts  this is not peace people at peace do not kill and maim each other with poison 
0,wow  bernie disagrees with poisoning people   just like me      feel the bern
0,the government has horribly failed their citizens what we need now  is bigger government to fix the problem 
0,i do nt like the  think about the children   line how about we re poisoning everyone in the region 
0,i am surprised that none of the billionaires in this country have thought to give back to an american city in need  the american people would love anyone who could do that public universities and private foundations could compete for the prestige of making flint great again 
0,gt  mr sanders said that he didn  t want to be  overly political  but that he had called for the resignation of gov rick snyder of michigan   if the local government can not protect those children  if the state government can not protect those children  then the federal government better   he said  oh really  well you just politicized it dipshit um is nt this a utility and a failure of local government  the federal government would do the exact same thing as the governor and delegate responsibility locally what party was running the city  nevermind i already know the answer  fuck you bernie you re so full of shit 
0,some politicians talk about getting rid of those darn regulations  one said it ll eliminate poverty if we do   i think i d like to see a few more  and maybe some funding for the people running things   unsafe lead levels in tap water not limited to flint   http  wwwnytimescom20160209usregulatorygapsleaveunsafeleadlevelsinwaternationwidehtml

0,does nt this simply show that people are willing to pay a lot of money to hear hillary s views  and that wall street has a lot of respect for her global perspective  regardless of her policy proposals   i know it s easy to paint her as prowall street for this  but getting paid for a speech is far from lobbying for wall street or being  bought and paid for  anyone familiar with her platform would know that  i would be more skeptical if she spoke for free 
0,we did nt want obama to approach this job as a cynic  by now he has earned it while most have gotten frustrated watching it  this has been his entire waking life for over 7 years i would like to hear his commentaries of the process once he no longer has to keep decorum  this likely wo nt change  no matter who gets in each and every presidential contender left has pissed off a large number of people within the gop trump  rubio  jeb  and cruz are just as likely to be labeled the antichrist as sanders and hillary

0,did nt obama also take part in obstructing the approval of a bush scotus nominee 
0,everyone say it with me    elections have consequences 
0,i personally have completely become accustomed to it i expect them to obstruct just about every thing that touches the left half of the spectrum  and so far  they have 
0,what chaps my ass is mr obama did nt say this five years ago  when the pattern was already well established 
0, well  at least they re not filibustering to keep the other party s majority from voting   http  articleschicagotribunecom20060130news0601300193_1_filibusterjudgealitoconfirmation

0,hah  says the guy who has  himself  filibustered a scotus appointment 
0,shit  the dems would do the same thing both parties have to go 
0,dragging ass is only going to hurt the republicans with moderates and undecideds in the general election 
0,man those checks and balances of power in the constitution are a real downer 
0,this is a consequence of changing how the senators are elected it used to be that the house of representatives  and to some extent it is still called this   called the  people s house  basically  the senators used to be appointed by the states  and that was changed in the early part of last century  which puts a different kind of pressure on the senators to be as partisan as the house has always been 
0,we ve almost become accustomed to how obstructionist both parties can be with us stuck in the middle if only there were third parties and better voting systems to more accurately represent us 
0,we have three branches in order to separate powers this is part of it people act like this is something new the legislative branch  republican  is going to fight to leverage power from the executive branch  democrat  by trying to get more conservatives into the judicial branch a democratcontrolled senate would do the same to a republican president if roles were flipped and rbg s spot became available 
0,i m probably going to be shouted down for this  but i have to say  it s not congress s job to enable the president s agenda it is rather the president s job to faithfully execute the laws congress passes  if it decides to pass any so  yes  they ve obstructed his goals in office  but that s their prerogative likewise  while you and i may dislike it  if congress decides to attempt to hamper his goals in whatever ways its powers allow it to  that s part of the checks and balances present in the constitution  there s no clause in there saying   but if congress  really  wo nt play ball and you  really  want to do something  ignore them and do it anyway  that being said  he is free to tell them they are assholes if he wishes  honestly  i m happy to see a relatively inactive congress the us code is long enough

0,you did nt say it in your dream  carson you said it out loud on front of everyone you are awake this is the real life you were nt supposed to say it out loud 
0,this is such an obvious thing it almost has to go without saying if there was a republican president  the debate would ve gone like this   should president republican nominate a replacement justice   and then every candidate would ve said   of course  that s what the constitution says  if the democrats try to block the nomination they re clearly trying to impede democracy there s historical precedent of nominating justices  there s so much hypocrisy in modern politics it s disgusting at least admit that you only want obama to wait because he s not going to nominate a judge you agree with 
0,gt  carson said the supreme court has become a  political tool   adding that it might be time to look at term limits for the justices   when we enacted that program  the average age of death was 47 and now it  s 80 you know  things have changed  so we need to change with them   carson said  i m confused is ben carson making a well reasoned argument 
0,carson surprised me for once 
0,this precedent the gop speaks of  does not exist   http  wwwscotusblogcom201602supremecourtvacanciesinpresidentialelectionyears  
0,carson said something not crazy 
0,am i wrong or did they choose that photo as an homage to the kermit meme 
0,carson woke up just long enough to make a valid point but by the time the last word left his lips his eyes had returned to their familiar glazed appearance 
0,gt  then again  recognize that the two picks that the president has selected are ideologues  so there  s really no reason to believe that his next pick wouldn  t be an ideologue also  a  we d have to go back to anthony kennedy probably to find a supreme court nominee who was nt an ideologue  and even then  most were surprised kennedy s voting record turned out to be moderate  b  the president has nt picked yet therefore no one knows if this pick  who does not yet exist  is an ideologue  or not no one knows who it is  no one has had a chance to examine the person s record no one has had a chance to interview the person and to find out their thoughts and positions  basically  obama could pick someone so conservative that they make scalia seem like a bleedingheart liberal  and the republicans would still be opposed no on substance  but because its obama s pick they are opposed to everything obama does because obama did it they disagree with much of what obama does for substantive reasons  of course  but with all of it for the childish reason of trying to prevent obama from doing anything at all  even when they agree with him

0,i just want to say that this thumbnail is perfect 
0,does anyone else find it ironic that scalia would not agree with limiting terms of justices as carson throws out at the end

0,i see they forgot to keep drugging his coffee 
0,of course is this really not common knowledge  do people really not realize it s an attempt to let a republican president nominate someone 
0, sips coffee  but thats none of my business 
0,he s entirely right  the only reason that republicans are complaining about obama being able to appoint a nominee for justice is because they fear that he ll pick someone that they do nt like  the republicans all agree that obama is  undermining the constitution   those are words taken straight from marco rubio s mouth   but when he has a  constitutional duty  to perform  they scream  he s gon na pick someone we do nt like  he should nt obey the law   hippocracy at its best

0,the real question is  how did the reporter manage to get a full quote  every single reporter who has interviewed carson dozed off half way into the first sentence 
0,not only did he call the gop a bunch of hypocrites  but he also put forth an argument against the whole conservative ideology at the end lol 
0,wait did fucken ben carson have a moment of lucidity and logic  something grounded in reality and an analysis of the situation argued from logos instead of ethos  holy fucken shit

0,hillary delivers her hot button issues often repeated but with no details of how she could end racism or sexism she likes to talk about both 
0,electing obama did nt end racism  electing hillary wo nt end sexism  and electing bernie wo nt end antisemitism  so how about we vote on platforms rather than which bathroom the candidate uses 
0,it d be nice if the article included some context 
0,so apparently hillary clinton is going to end racism and sexism  that s what she s implying i think we can all see what s she s doing and how she s taking advantage of people it s really exploitative and toxic clinton does nt know how to not be a racist

0,to all the people saying  how hard it is to get an id  seriously  do a little research into how these states are making it as hard as possible closing down dmvs  requiring a birth certificate  but only the official one  not a copy more forms of id than was needed just a few years ago it s a pain in the ass and poor folks are affected by it a lot more that is entirely the point  you can drive your car and it s totally doable  great  now use public transport to go across town and spend hours at a now overcrowded dmv that has fucky hours that your job is nt friendly about giving you time for  a lot of poor folks get it done  but it fucks up an entire week of getting all the proper shit together it s maddening and it s never been needed before  why now  this research shows you exactly why now  i did nt need a birth certificate when i got my class a licence why did i need it to renew it

0,from the article   richard hasen  professor of law and political science at uc irvine school of law  cautioned against drawing conclusions from the paper  which is an outlier  the authors of the paper also collected no actual data  they just developed a statistical  model  that outputs the desired conclusion  voter id is rayciss   the article itself  is not even published in a peerreviewed journal   http  pagesucsdedu  zhajnalpage5documentsvoteridhajnaletalpdf   meaning it s just more politically motivated academic garbage you can take with a grain of salt

0,every other industrialized country and even third world countries require id to vote 
0,how hard is it to get an id 
0,i do nt know about this  honestly  i do nt really think the voter id thing should be a big deal  but there is literally no excuse to not have an id  just no valid excuse  i grew up in severe poverty to a single mother that worked multiple jobs and she still managed to get an id and so did i  you not getting an id is absolutely your own fault  so that is nt really a valid excuse 
0,brilliant episode about voting on last week tonight with jon oliver the best part is at 10  00 when republican lawmakers expose the real intent of voter id laws  http  youtuberhfowlmcdto
0,the big difference here is that one group is using odd year cycles in which voter participation is low to gain an advantage while the other group is limiting voter participation in all elections  in the first case  there s nothing that prevents the electorate from participating in full other than their own apathy in the second  there is a barrier to full participation  there s a distinct difference between using the rules to your advantage and changing the rules to your advantage  edit  the only  legitimate  problem that is solved by voter id laws is voter impersonation one person casting a vote as another  while ostensibly also casting their own vote  there have been fewer than 31 incidents of this type for over 1 billion votes cast   https  wwwwashingtonpostcomnewswonkwp20140806acomprehensiveinvestigationofvoterimpersonationfinds31credibleincidentsoutofonebillionballotscast  so this is a problem that has a 0000000031  impact on our elections but denies the vote to hundreds of thousands of americans

0,if voting requires an id and you have to pay for that id how is that not a violation of the 24th amendment 
0,there was a fun little experiment done a couple years ago that showed that if you re a state legislator who supports voter id  you ve probably got racial biases in how you respond to your constituents  http  papersssrncomsol3paperscfm  abstract_id  2422596 basically  they sent out identical letters half signed with an anglo sounding name  half with a latino sounding name among legislators that supported voter id  the anglo sounding names were responded to over twice as often as the latino names there was little discrepancy with legislators that did not support voter id laws 
0,if you are an adult and do nt have an id  i m going to assume you re not a very productive member of society  democrats are just angry that voter id hinders their give people a bunch of free shit and bus them to polling stations strategy

0,that s the point 
0,wrote my college thesis on this issue via a case study of indiana vs massachusetts  2014   voter id laws particularly affected hundreds of thousands of hispanics  african americans  women  and elderly wouldbe voters voter id laws also resulted in less than 20 voter fraud convictions takeaway  voter id laws disenfranchise certain groups at an astronomically larger volume than said laws combat voter fraud 
0,why are people trying to remove voter id laws instead of removing the limitations on poor people to get their id s  if you lock yourself out of your car you do nt decide to remove all the locks you keep a spare key somewhere 
0,i find it troubling how partisan the language in the paper s conclusion is at one point  the authors state that  there is a desperate need for hard  empirical evidence  but then go on to say with what seems to be a high degree of confidence that white americans have a growing influence in the political process whereas racial minorities are finding it harder to vote  the fact that this paper is such an outlier when compared to similar studies on the relation between voter id requirements and turnout is concerning when paired with the rhetoric used by the authors of this paper 
0,so organize and get people registered and out to vote they did it in the 1960 s why can not it be done now 
0,well duh  if the repugs are responsible for implementing anything  then by definition it s biased against democrats and minorities the gop  the party of old  rich  white people oh yeah  add in scared to that list 
0,i understand both arguments being made in this thread i think a politically easy solution to solve all of this would be to create an automatic voter registration where every individual can have a voter id shipped to their house when they are 17  to participate in primary if they are 18 by election day   does anyone know how much a federal program like this would cost 
0,why does rpolitics suck europe s dick when it comes to healthcare and taxes but completely ignore the average european reaction to learning that the usa does nt require id to vote

0,no shit
0,when elections teeter on a couple points and billions are spent campaigning  i d think it a pretty easy strategy to go get those people ids 
0,so they do exactly what they were intended to do 
0,id laws also suppress people who need to drive a car  open a bank account  buy booze  rent movies from a store  validate credit card purchases  get a legit job  get married maybe having an id is nt so bad 
0,what is the data on voter fraud  last i heard  there s not much of it at all and that the premise is largely baseless 
0,how the hell is asking for an id a bad thing  this will always confuse me you need an id for pretty much everything 
0,something that applies to everyone equally  is racist   read more about it 
0,by using that logic so does the act of voting itself i ca nt believe they make people get out of their house and go to a place and vote what about people with no legs  what about the people who ca nt read 
0,it s not in the constitution anywhere that says americans are free from having to have documents i think people are imposing liberties that never existed  i think the far left often uses this tactic to fool people in the middle  i do nt see it as unreasonable to actually enforce the law when determining who s running the country i do nt understand why i m supposed to let voter fraud be even a possibility instead  people will claim things like racism  rightwing conspiracy  or something else that convinces me the moderates are being tricked

0,really the clinton campaign  does nt  have the funds first  they spend 3040  on polling alone second  their base cost for their expansive campaign  salaries  daily promotionals  etc  is really high that s like another 30   now consider that something like 65  of their donors are already maxed outso there s no returning to the well there she has a cash flow problem  which is why she s starting to draw the superpac money into the race 
0,just some stuff about priorities usa action  1  the article identifies it as  hillary clinton s superpac  but that s not really that accurate they support clinton now  but they were setup as barack obama s  official  superpac for the 2012 election establishment gon na establish  2  superpacs do have to disclose donors   here s 2012 for obama   https  wwwopensecretsorgpacspacgave2php  cmte  c00495861amp  cycle  2012    here s 2016 for hillary   https  wwwopensecretsorgpacspacgave2php  cmte  c00495861amp  cycle  2016   big donors are mostly hollywood execs  soros gave a lot though he always does  then it s a pretty diverse mix  it s not like it says  goldman sachs  all the way down  however yeah it s fair to say  100000 donations aint coming from the middle class  not really trying to take a position  just wanted to share facts i thought pertinent

0,gt  the atlanta democrat made his decision public just hours before sanders is set to speak at a morehouse college rally aimed at enticing black voters to give his campaign a second look fort  who is also considering a run for atlanta mayor    had endorsed clinton weeks ago    gt     after months of looking at bernie  s record and studying his positions   on healthcare  wall street  predatory lending and the minimum wage    i came to the conclusion that bernie  s position on the issues that affect my constituents in georgia the most conform most closely to my positions     said fort  really  it s all that it takes  compare and contrast hillary and bernie s record and platform the more people study bernie  the more likely they ll support him this is just one of many congressmen and women who will flip their endorsements 
0,i live in marietta i just called senator fort s office to say  thank you  for his support of senator sanders 
0,good for him  but why is it front page news that a state senator flips  are we that desperate for positive bernie news that we ll upvote even a minor thing like this and proclaim it as the beginning of the end 
0,gt  the no2 democrat in the georgia senate bernie endorsed by the democratic establishment

0,what does this mean  should we all decide to vote for bernie now 
0,making georgia proud 
0,heck yeah 
0,momentum
0,i am not sure why rpolitics is so rabid over sanders  clinton is going to be the next democratic nominee for president look at the math guys 
0,he was supporting someone like clinton until now 
0,fort has lots of enemies in both parties hahaha he s a prominent figure but not that prominent some would say he s a joke 
0,and so it begins 
0,i am i the only one who think that this is the opposite of the point i want people to support bernie because the majority of the democratic party members want to support him i do not want people flipping their support without counting a single vote in georgia 
0,someone remind me  is it  rats leaving a sinking ship  or  cockroaches leaving a sinking wall street whore  
0,proud to be georgian today  edit  hahaha i have no idea why i m being downvoted  must be the hillary brigade
0,watching hillary lose this election will be thoroughly satisfyingbut not as satisfying as watching her get arrested 
0,looks like this dude got berniesplained 
0,ca nt not be feeling it 
0,good man 
0,i guess this guy s word is nt as strong as leahy s what filth
0,she s in harlem right now bellowing about how white babies get better asthma treatment then black babies she will pander to anyone 
0,gt  bernie is a problem hillary can  t figure out how to solve  perhaps because he  s not the problem she is   damn  usa today tell us how you really feel   edit   kristen powers  the author of the article  was a member of the clinton organization near the beginning of her career she has since been firm in her support of universal health care and immigration reform  including a path to citizenship however  her stance on social policies are less obvious it s unclear who she supports it s only clear that she has a strong dislike for the clintons 
0,to me  hillary appears to be a government employee looking for the promotion she feels she earned  contrarily  bernie appears to me to be a civil servant seeking to serve a larger electorate  such perspectives will naturally guide campaigns 
0,most recently  hillary seems to be making her platform   i m just like bernie  but i can actually succeed   which feels increasingly desperate 
0,gt  the new york times reported that clinton  s flailing campaign is trying out a new line  that   sanders is a  onenote  candidate who is captive to an  obsession  with wall street and campaign spending   clinton is determined to prove that sanders is not ready for office  but that she is    if we broke up the big banks tomorrow   clinton asked a group of union members   would that end racism  would that end sexism  would that end discrimination against the lgbt community     so is hillary s main campaign platform  ending racism and sexism  i thought a campaign on ending corruption in government due to big money and handing back power to the american people would be a better idea  gt  just so we  re clear  sanders is an unserious pieinthesky candidate because he wants to rein in campaign spending and institute a health care system that is commonplace in europe clinton  on the other hand  will eradicate sexism and racism in america who  s the dreamer here  after all  clinton can  t even keep her own campaign surrogates  gloria steinem and madeleine albright  from taking sexist swipes at young female bernie supporters  yup  there s this weird argument that bernie s ideas are fantasy and can not happen   even though plenty of other countries have already done it   http  iimgurcomtwl5nkppng   they ll use lines like  usa is bigger and more diverse or congressional obstructionism will prevent any of bernie s policies from happening  as if hillary would fare better with that reasoning   gt  clinton  s attack is  not surprisingly  dishonest  i think most here will agree with this last statement 
0,back when hillary ran against obama  i remember thinking that she would make a better president than obama  but that she could never win a general election i do nt remember disliking her  even when she went a bit negative  this year it s a bit different i still believe she is absolutely incapable of winning a general election the republicans just hate her too much the base will come out to vote against her  even if they wo nt come out to support trump or cruz or whatever empty suit they nominate  but this year  i m finding myself really disliking clinton on so many counts  her platform simply wo nt solve our problems her motives are clearly all about hillary her rhetoric is so crafted to mislead she s attacking a guy who has refused to attack her back  hillary is pretending to steal bernie s issues  without having the decency to actually do so she offers weaker versions of his plans  but claims they are stronger and she uses cheap rhetorical tricks to obfuscate the differences between her plans and bernies it s not a battle of ideas for her it s just manipulation and taking advantage of the confusion she s deliberately causing  she s clearly taken too much money from too many special interests to ever be impartial  let alone tough on their industries  worst of all is her condescending tone when speaking to young people she refuses to acknowledge their problems  and does nt seem at all interested in actually courting them she does nt think their votes matter she s sure they ll stay home i would nt mind all this if her actual platform and agenda was going to improve their lives but it wo nt  because has no understanding of their problems  i just ca nt vote for hillary i just ca nt she s a bad  bad candidate she will be a terrible president  i might get out and vote against donald trump getting the nuclear codes  if it comes to that but i m praying bernie pulls off the upset 
0,hillary essentially wants to maintain the status quo  which is nt exactly a great campaign slogan when so many people are alienated by the current political system 
0,can we please have more substantive discussions on why bernie sanders  ideas are the best ideas  i tend to agree with him  but at this point we have pretty much saturated reddit with these posts link to econometric articles  or tax policy articles  etc 
0,how is this title allowed 
0,in a way  this is how government is supposed to work  she s going to change her stance to represent the will of the people in order to win the election  because the election system essentially demands that  what i m concerned with is which ideals politicians will pander to  when politicians say that they think pp will make partial birth abortions mandated for all people  i want to hate that politician and their voters  when politicians say that they think gay marriage should be legal  but they did nt think that before  of course i m going to be suspect of their opinion but i am glad that they changed their mind to that stance  and i m glad the voters put that pressure on 
0,till date no hillary supporter has been able to tell me what her agenda is and why she wants to be president
0,fuck s sake people  i m a bernie fan and have never liked hillary  but this is getting absurd 5600 upvotes for an essay that offers absolutely nothing new of substance  and is just a retread of an established talking point for the past two months 
0,i know rpolitics is probernie  and i have yet to make up my mind however  that title makes me cringe  especially since the article linked is nt titled that way 
0,in light of scalia s passing  hillary has been doubling down on her claim that she is the more  electable  of the two yet  when those who value trustworthiness flock to bernie s side  by 91  to 5   even that claim is dubious 
0,this is literally an opinion article and does nt belong here 
0,gt  your headline must be comprised only of the copied and pasted headline of the article  a continuous quote taken from the article  or both the headline and a continuous quote taken from the article if using a quote  it should reflect the article as a whole  how is this title appropriate  it s 100  opinion 
0, i m not a one issue candidate because we are not a one issue country  misses the mark money in politics is the issue how can you have an honest conversation about any other issue when special interest groups hold sway over the political system and people s interests  she s nibbling at the edges and bernie is going straight for the heart 
0,holy fuck  this place is just an extension of that sanders subreddit 
0,why is it i keep get getting good news about bernie and bad news about hillary on reddit  seriously any hillary followers on here

0,come on op  have a little courtesy by keeping this kind of onesided discussion in bernie s subreddit 
0,sanders  campaign is about us hillary s campaign is about her  ca nt imagine the latter would be inspiring to anyone other than monarchists 
0,i wish people had reasonable discussions on reddit instead of just making hillary out to be this evil selfcentered fiend when you state that her only motivation for being president is because it s her turn it makes me think you re either being intentionally manipulative or you re just plain stupid

0,secretaries of state break up big banks 
0,to be fair al gore came to my town  that is in the netherlands  last year to speak they paid him   150k iirc  i did nt go  tickets were quite expensive but i was pretty shocked how much some people get paid for a less than two hour speech
0,since when does the secretary of state has to deal with breaking banks or not 
0,so we ve moved on to supposition articles now 
0,if he had clinton s resume and was nt trying to dismantle the banking system  absolutely it s not like she was the only person they paid to speak they had an entire speaker series featuring successful people from diverse backgrounds 
0,secretary of state is foreign policy  she was nt the damn secretary of treasury  holy hell the misinformation and bad thought processes
0,the secretary of state is being taken to task for notbreaking up domestic banks  this is officially the dumbest anticlinton thing on rpolitics this week 
0,absolutely you are out of your minds if you think bankers are nt going to want to hear the outgoing treasury secretary speak 
0,i am fairly certain that if bernie sanders had been treasury secretary  that he would have been courted for speeches to banking events no matter what type of policy he had 
0,if goldman sachs is run by  say  surly junior high kids or ted cruz  yeah  i would nt pay to hear from enemies  if  however  i wanted to get a perspective of someone who did  indeed  regulate my business and lower my profit margin  i would want hear from them i would want to know their unvarnished perspective as the winner  in order to alter my strategy this is because i m a grownup  this does nt have anything to do with hilary  just that the premise of the title assumes that fifth graders run the world which  granted  may be true 
0,no  a bank would nt want someone who s actively trying to stop them from profiting so handsomely speaking at their institution  because you know exactly what a bernie speech to goldman sachs would sound like 
0,this speaking program is not some big secret you can go  look at their website   http  wwwgoldmansachscomourthinkingtalksatgs  for lots of information the point  according to one redditor who worked at a big bank  is simply  getting famous people to draw potential clients   https  npredditcomrpoliticscomments45xcbkwhile_clinton_and_many_on_the_left_decryd00xb90  context  3   the speakers are famous people of all stripes  prominent athletes  scientists  retired military  entrepreneurs  russel simmons  dean kamen   the archbishop of canterbury  etc  there are some leftyoutsider people too such as amory lovins and linda hirshman  but in general not that many are politicians because not that famous 
0,not a fan of hilary and do nt believe she has any desire to be super tough against big moneycorporationsbanks or whatever  but her job as secretary of state had nothing to do with the economy 
0,gt  if this sounds strange  let s imagine a slightly different scenario suppose bernie sanders had spent four years in president obama s cabinet during which time he did everything he could to try to break up the big banks and have corporate criminals put behind bars does anyone believe goldman sachs would pay him  250000 to recount his experiences  yes 
0,yes hillary clinton completely failed in her capacity as secretary of the treasury jesus fucking christ guys  quit shoving this shit down my throat 
0,why do we need to break up the big banks  it s not like tesla and apple and amazon and all the big companies can bank at the neighborhood credit union if we orderly capital markets and a strong economy we have to have the big banks 
0,ridiculous and obtuse argument but does nt matter because fuck hillary      _    _  
0,so she was an awful sos because she did nt break up big banks 
0,this article is just the consistent  hillary takes money from big banks  argument  only reworded poorly and framed in a way that makes no sense
0,secretary of state has nothing to do with domestic financial institutions people in this thread are so dumb 
0,yes  well maybe not 250k since he wasnt first lady as well  but there would probably be a big interest in getting him as speaker too
0,why would you think bernie would do that  there s a huge difference between what a politician with no real power will say versus what one will actually do once he is in power 
0,you people are the worst get past her speaking circuit money talk about a more interesting nonissue like her terrible yellow coat 
0,gt  it s not just that the politician wants to act to curry the favor of the rich and powerful  more typically they identify with the interests of the rich and powerful so that they do nt even see themselves as compromising a principle  gt  when we actually see money being handed over to politicians from the wealthy  whether in the form of large speaking fees or a highpaying job  it is probably best to think of it as analogous to a valentine present no one loves their spouse or significant other because of a generous valentine gift  rather it is a symbol of ongoing affection 
0,self posts not allowed oh wait unless it s from a corporate entity it is
0,yes  they just want to throw money around for the fun of it have you not watch the wolf of wall street 
0,not the best analogy being in the cabinet does nt mean you just get to do whatever you want you d probably have to stay in your lane  how about   bernie sanders spent his 30year political career not just talking about income inequality and the necessity of government regulation on big banks  but acting on it does anyone believe goldman sachs would pay him  250000 to recount his experiences  
0,gt  suppose bernie sanders had spent four years in obama s cabinet and tried to break up the big banks does anyone believe goldman sachs would pay him  250000 to recount his experiences  except hillary did nt say that by all accounts given so far  it was more a rahrah speech than it was her telling goldman of her accounts of trying to break up the big banks so this entire statement is based on a false supposition 
0,i find it funny how almost every comment here is making fun of the stupidity of this post and article yet the article has 4000 points  87  liked  and is sitting at the top of reddit 
0,we ran out of everything else and now we re down to making up shit entirely eh 
0,the top comments in this thread are all people who only read the quote and not the entire article smh
0,wtf what a stupid argument clinton was sec state  not the sec treasury or head of any regulatory agency so she would nt be doing anything to threaten banks they likley had her speak bc she s a clinton  been around and former sec state  even if she was a regulator  it would nt surprise me if she would speak at a banking event  and any  breaking up of banks  would be bc congress came up with a law with regs requiring them to divest themselves of certain busiensses  ie reinstating glass  steagall provisions 
0,are you kidding  of course they would  why do you think it s the toughest most vicious prosecutorsregulators get hired by the banks  not only do poachers make the best gamekeepers  but it also takes them out of the equation if gs offered bernie a million to do some work for them it would make it much harder for him to come down on them later 
0,hillary is a status quo presidential candidate  if she gets the nomination and the job things will remain mostly as they are with little attempt to change them  the big banks know this 
0,just another way of saying what bernie said in the last debate   i m paraphrasing   i guess these banks just love to throw away money  right   it s obvious to anyone who will think about it  but plenty of people are invested in not thinking about it 
0,know thine enemy so yes they would he would most likely refuse it regardless if he was retired or not 
0,you mean  650k
0,i thing goldman sachs is double playing you all 250k is absolutely nothing to them but it is enough to appear to support hillary without really helping her this obviously actually hurts her and helps sanders  the one they really want in office because they can us him to suck the blood out of our economy and send us into depression  where sachs will profit massively 
0,exactly this  if i do not explicitly see it  it does nt exist  mantra is ridiculously short sighted i ve said the same thing before  probably on here   the politicians that do literally change their vote for cash  seem to be the ones that get caught the goal of the money is to bring these people into the same social strata as those with the money make them part of the club the more they hang out  the more washed over with those ideals they will be dishonesty is not a simple process 
0,ofcoursenothetalkstoslow 
0,sanders supporters  one problem is that some of us ca nt get on board with the evil wall street stuff it s very difficult legally to say exactly why and how you re going to prosecute bankers for what happened in 2008 it s very difficult to craft regulations to correct exactly the things we want without having either very bad unintended consequences  or loopholes that render them useless i see it as a problem we have as a country  and something we really need to think about and be smart about bernie actually kinda scares me with his us vs them stuff  if you have the time  take a look at  this video   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  qclmwlgcgg0  of a slightly boring economist who s studied the problem extensively to me this is kind of talk and approach we need if we really want to solve the problem sure  it s not a rousing as bernie s power to the people  stuff  but there you go let the republicans have their demagogues  someone needs to be the smart party 
0,i think it would be money well spent they can learn about his mindset and how to take evasive action for next time 
0,if he actually tried to break up the banks  getting a detailed debriefing of what worked  did nt work  and his thoughts on the matter   250k would be a bargain  think about it if you ran a company with billions in profit  and you spent millions on lobbying  paying think tanks  and other expensive tactics to prevent legislation and regulatory action against it spending  250k to find out from the other side what is actually working and not working would worth every penny 
0,does no one here remember anything that happened back when the clintons were still in arkansas  anyone that wants this person to be the leader of the   free world   has either had their head in the sand for the past 40 years  does nt pay attention to the history of this family  does nt care  or is probably under the age of 25 
0,that is so good  it should be in rshowerthoughts people are starting to wake up   
0,absofuckinglutely the correct question is do you think he d take it
0,if i were a wall street wolf  i would pay 250k for them to tell me how they tried to stop me  so i could learn more about how to defend my stake  and also because 250k is chump change 
0,every economist believes this is not going to do anything another big bank will just come up a few years after i think effective legislationlaws is a better action 
0,gt  the wages of other workers would fall since displaced manufacturing workers would be forced to look for jobs in retail and other sectors the increased supply of workers lowers wages in these other sectors as well recent research by some of the country s top labor economists confirms that trade has been a major factor depressing the wages of large numbers of workers  step 1  have your husband  as president  champion legislation that ships manufacturing to china step 2  walmart becomes the country s largest employer of new lowwage workers step 3  get on the board of directors at walmart step 4  profit  step 5  run for president

0,how could they do this to their own abuela 
0,if you re a nonwhite american voter in nevada or south carolina  would nt you be a little angry to be regarded as part of a firewall  by this lady 
0,as an asian american  i m always a bit envious of minorities like blacks and hispanics who actually get touched upon in political campaigns and who people  journalists  activists  seem to always care about  the only asian firewall you ll hear of in the news is in china and its the technical usage of the term firewall 
0,god the lack of good polls pisses me off  i have no idea how to feel about nevada 
0,hillary s firewall is getting berned 
0,is nt saying  blacks are my firewall  or  latinos are my firewall  a bit weird   why did she start using that  firewall  phrase  
0,uh other way around latinos are losing faith in hrc 
0,of course they are the reality is that the more latinos and blacks learn about sanders  the more likely they will vote for him the only hurdle for them is awareness sanders  policies will make their lives better  period clinton s policies will just be the same old dc bullshit would you choose a better life or a shit life 
0, oh  no  my abuela  
0,he was polling at like 35  among hispanics a few months ago with his recent surge i would nt be surprised if he was tied with her or even ahead now

0,so now hillary wants a wall 
0,man  both her and trump expect mexicans to build walls for them 
0,why the fuck is everything a firewall these days  why did i never hear this term any other election cycle 
0,i m in las vegas and i m switching from republican to democrat today so i can vote bernie on the 20th my family is probably gon na disown me but fuckem 
0,the way we keep using this  firewall  phrase  it sounds like she uses the bodies of the impoverished minorities to protect her fortune very disturbing image when you think about it 
0,hillary won the popular vote 
0,heh strange how vox quotes  latino firewall  in the headline but not in the article and in no way makes any indication of whom they re quoting i do nt believe i ve ever heard clinton use the term  latino firewall  so as for now  that s just vox saying stupid shit for clicks which is par for course 
0,the only people using the term  firewall  are in the media  usually in a way that is negative towards hrc s campaign  and yet redditors jump on the  this is offensive  bandwagon lol  wtf 
0,yes  let s all vote for the old white career politician 
0,i dislike salon but damn that s a fair  great piece 
0,i m really hoping sanders picks her as a running mate  if she d accept   she s a fabulous politician though having her in the senate may allow her to affect more 
0,in what world does clinton s remark at the end make sense  you ca nt criticise the current president because you re in the same party  does she really expect that kind of partisanship  does she think it s a good thing 
0,i would bet that if bernie wins the nomination warren will be top choice for vpgiven bernie s age it would be a coup if she accepted 
0,i have nt looked in a while but it seems as these two are very compatible as politicians maybe they could go as running mates 
0,i thought the bill press interview was super interesting is it possible to get a link for the full version 
0,not sure why she s bothering  as she s guaranteed the nomination 
0,she lost iowa in 2008 and won new hampshire and had a smaller national lead 
0,actually  i think she did nt run  because he is they re definitely similar  and i would like to see her do big things in years to come i think they re paving the way for each other to make revolutionary changes she makes me so proud to be form massachusetts

0,the simple fact that the clintons do not understand why this is wrong is symptomatic of their narcissism  imo 
0,the clintons love skirting the rules as long as it benefits them i do not want them representing the democratic party and will either refuse to vote or write in bernie sanders if hillary becomes the nominee

0,but i thought kashkari was a goldmansachs shill s you can read his full remarks  here   https  wwwminneapolisfedorgnewsandeventspresidentsspeecheslessonsfromthecrisisendingtoobigtofail  gt  i believe we must begin this work now and give serious consideration to a range of options  including the following  breaking up large banks into smaller  less connected  less important entities  turning large banks into public utilities by forcing them to hold so much capital that they virtually can  t fail  with regulation akin to that of a nuclear power plant   taxing leverage throughout the financial system to reduce systemic risks wherever they lie 
0,pretty funny rpolitics is all over kashkari right now  but when he ran as a republican for governor of california back in 2014 he was labeled a shill and considered to be one of the worst men in california 
0,you know sanders campaign is having an effect on this country from top to bottom when headlines like this start popping up try and imagine seeing a headline like this back in 2006  it sounds ridiculous to even think about 
0,oh  so now we re listening to former goldman sachs employees and members of the fed  that s interesting 
0,wanting to place an arbitrary limit on the size of financial institutions is one of the strangest ideas to gain mainstream acceptance in the field of economics  the problem is not that banks are too big  it s that they re too leveraged  given the networking effects involved in finance  having 10 overleveraged small banks may not be any better than having one big overleveraged bank it may actually be easier to regulate and monitor the big one 
0,this is called damage control banks and the fed know reform is coming it s better to control your own fate than let others do it for you 
0,people forget that the federal reserve bank    is not    a government organization it is a privately owned institution it is  the  big bank 
0,he s wrong about  not seeing the next crisis   banks are still selling cdo s and we re due for another housing bubble it wo nt be as bad as the last one due to consumer confidence being low and inhibiting the unbridled optimism that fueled the last one rest assured that we can expect more of the same when the markets correct again
0,there is only one issue i have with what he said and perhaps some on who has a higher degree in economics than i do can explain why i m wrong  i have a minor in economics but does nt increased capital requirements mean banks have much less money to lend thus reducing the amount of money in existence  in economic terms anyway  and thus inflating the value of the dollar  since there is less of it in circulation  causing exports to weaken and imports to strengthen and if my understanding serves one of the problems of the recession was that bank credit simply dried up would nt this idea lead to a similar thing happening  also how small are we talking of making these banks  because economies of scale are still important to keep in mind when redistributing the banking system 
0,this is what they called nationalizing the banks usually we re very clear that we want the government to stay out of our personal finances 
0,he s just pandering nothing to see here

0,gt  clinton leads sanders 50 percent to 40 percent heading into south carolina  whose democratic voting electorate is more racially diverse than either iowa or new hampshire  sanders holds a narrow 3point advantage over clinton  47 percent to 44 percent  among white voters  gt  while sanders has drawn a significant portion of his support from the youngest voting bloc  under the age of 30   just 25 percent of millennial black voters said they are supporting the vermont senator  compared with 64 percent who said they are backing clinton the reverse is true among white millennials  who support sanders 75 percent to 22 percent  gt  the poll was conducted online from feb 814  surveying 11417 registered voters nationwide the survey s overall margin of error is plus or minus 11 percentage points  this  graph   http  media2snbcnewscomjnewscms2016_071418976nbcsurveymonkey_weekly_election_tracking_poll_clinton_sanders_chartbuilder_adabea7e779bf0fd083d1d5d52364cffnbcnewsux28801000png  that i found  here   http  wwwnbcnewscompolitics2016electionclintonmaintainsnationalleadoversandersafternhlossn519076  shows the national poll  s and sanders slowly  but steadily climbing it also shows hillary s decline on a somewhat sharper slant  due to her own campaign implosions 
0,this is the 2nd national poll since nh that real clear politics refuses to put up 
0,ah yes  the daily  sanders is closing the gap  post 
0,i m glad he s closing the gap  but i would of thought the gap should be smaller given all the scandals surrounding clinton 
0,this is confirmed by  this graph   http  pollingreuterscom  polltr131  of a very informative running poll he s closing the gap among  blacks   http  pollingreuterscom  polltr131filterssc_race  2  very quickly too  a 2540  change over one month  one troubling conclusion from this particular data set for the sanders campaign is that he is gaining almost all of his support from previous nonvoters rather than from converted hillary supporters  particularly in the general population   the early registration deadlines in many states will prevent a large chunk of sanders  momentum from translating to actual votes  since his new supporters will be unable to register up to a month before the primary  for example  in texas  previously unregistered voters activated by his results in iowa  new hampshire and the considerable media attention he s received since then will not be able to vote for him the cumulative effect of this over all states might decide the entire primary election 
0,interesting piece of data from this poll  gt  while sanders has drawn a significant portion of his support from the youngest voting bloc  under the age of 30   just 25 percent of millennial black voters said they are supporting the vermont senator  compared with 64 percent who said they are backing clinton the reverse is true among white millennials  who support sanders 75 percent to 22 percent  this does nt really conform with the media narrative i wonder if there are other polls with similar results 
0,i m sure this has been posted before but has anyone seen this  a bunch of really conservative people have posted this on facebook today and i m worried it is going to hurt bernie in the polls if anyone reads this is there any truth to it  also i m voting for bernie regardless but i just wanted to hear what others had to say  http  wwwthegatewaypunditcom201602berniesandersabumwhodidntearnhisfirstpaycheckuntilage40  mtcid  cf
0,and today s poll has clinton up 21 points in sc national polls do nt really mean much right now it s great he s more widely known nationally but he s done if he does nt perform well in the south 
0,the mother of all cherrypicked polls 
0,national polls do nt matter if he ca nt close the gap with minorities  unfortunately 
0,unfortunately  he s about to get crushed in south carolina  http  projectsfivethirtyeightcomelection2016primaryforecastsouthcarolinademocratic
0,bernie sanders and the whitehouse  if you think the two do nt go together  you re not alone but you re also wrong  not that he would hold that against you because sanders  with apologies to the democrats  barack obama  is perhaps the nicest and most sincere man in politics and has been for 40 years  walk through congress with sanders before the gates open and you ll see him greet the security guards and ushers by name sit near the podium during fillibusters and you ll hear him call out to the lobbyists watch him afterward and you ll find him standing patiently by his locker  respectfully answering the lamest questions from reporters representing the smallest hometown newspapers  that was nt something you would see with hillary clinton  clinton would question your parentage  sanders will ask about your kids  then listen intently to the answer  when the supreme court held a memorial service for justice scalia  sanders flew to texas to see his family  then flew right back to take part in the service never mind that it was his only day off in a month  it s just respect   sanders said  yet a politician who shows respect to everyone does nt always see it in return  clearly sanders lacks the glitz and glamour  the flamboyance and the egotism to stand out in a tabloid world which is why he s thought of primarily as a nice guy and not a great politician  truth is  he s both  he s also crew cuts and blue collars he s middle america  right down to the  please  and  thank you  in his world  guns are for hunting  not for carrying into night clubs  no wonder the license plate on his pickup truck  what else would he drive   once read dbth  shorthand for do nt believe the hype  but you can believe the numbers  which make a strong case that sanders should be the president  in this case  a nice guy should finish first 
0,how many articles do we have to post about him closing the gap  how about posting an article when he closes it 
0,no he s not he s not even close conservative news outlets said the same thing about romney in 2012 just to give false hope even going as far as saying he won the election stop posting sensationalized headlines from misleading sources  edit  the people down voting me because i m stating facts are just as bad as the audience at the last republican debate who booed the moderators for stating facts 
0,gt  trump holds the support of one in three evangelical voters  33 percent  oh  i get it now  those are the hard core evangelicals who want to hasten judgement day trump is their protest vote against this earthly planet
0,i think you really ought to have highlighted this paragraph  gt  while sanders has drawn a significant portion of his support from the youngest voting bloc  under the age of 30     just 25 percent of millennial black voters   said they are supporting the vermont senator  compared with 64 percent who said they are backing clinton   the reverse is true among white millennials  who support sanders 75 percent to 22 percent   sanders supporters are young  white liberals all this talk of  closing the gap  is going to be embarrassing in just a few weeks very similar to the way evangelicals thought the rapture was coming 
0,black voters know that sanders  goals  as good as they might sound  are politically unrealistic hillary is the better choice because at least she will raise the minimum wage to  12  which is more than most people make

0,have trickle down economics worked anywhere 
0,here is a 43page report by the nonpartisan congressional research service which analyzes tax rates since 1945 and shows  unequivocally  that trickle down is a big  fat lie  http  wwwdpccsenategovfilesdocumentscrstaxesandtheeconomy  20top  20ratespdf

0,this needs to be higher jindal pulled the wool over everyone s eyes for years by shifting money around now the great state of louisiana is spending the lowest on higher education in the nation because we simply do nt have any money forget the scholarships  they re not even sure they can keep the universities open anymore 
0,supplyside economics works  people  and by  works  i mean of course  it immediately runs your state over a cliff and into a deep ravine   kansas   280 million short  louisiana   940 million short  oklahoma   13   b   illion short

0, demandside  economics is just as stupid  the economy is a function of supply and demand seems most idiots think it s either  supplyside driven  or  demandside driven   both exceptionally stupid notions
0,right wing economics have never worked in the history of the world  they are just to stupid to realize 
0,a big reason la is in a pickle is the bottoming out of the oil industry the state budget is made with assumptions on oil prices per barrel 
0,everybody knows the best economies are ones where the people in government take our money  rake off vig for themselves and their patrons  then redirect it in ways they think are best krugman said it best  when we give the people in government  1 they will allocate it so efficiently that the we will see a  3 bang for that buck  but if you and i keep that dollar decide for ourselves how to use it way that meets our needs we will see only an   80 bang for the buck  at least that s what the people in government tell me  edit stupid new keyboard
0,the fact that senate republicans will attempt to block an obama nominee is no surprise what is surprising is the assertion that he should nt even attempt to replace justice scalia  even though he has nearly a year left in office it s as though somehow that would be unseemly to leave the supreme court without a tie breaking vote until 2017 is not in the best interest of the country 
0,this is literally one of the things i specifically voted for 
0,gt  senate inaction likely means the court will be without one justice for two terms the next supreme court term will be nearly half over when the next president is sworn in  and even if that president nominates quickly  confirmation is unlikely before the term  s end that means two years of potential 44 deadlocks that leave the court unable to decide major constitutional issues thus refusing to even vote on a nominee is not just an abdication of constitutional duty  it will manufacture a constitutional crisis  this should be the lede senate inaction could split the court 44 for the 20152016 term and the 20162017 term sitting on this nomination means it ll be   october of 2018   before the court opens a term with a full bench 
0,minor point but is nt this incorrect  gt  scalia is the first supreme court justice to die midterm since robert jackson in 1954 rehnquist died on the bench in 2005 
0,reps are inna pickle  they either scorch earth obama s pick and bet they get the wh next year  or hedge and comprimise on a moderate obama may slip a more moderate person in if they hedge their bets  but where it s going either  next dem inserts way more liberal that obamas pick or  r  win the wh and can put a conservative judge in  but that is in turn  betting on trump s continued koolaid wallsmashing rise to the presidency  so i got ta ask em do you feel lucky 
0,if the late justice had died on january 15th of next year  ok  they might have a point at that point it s a week until inauguration  nothing s going to get done in that time  but it would be classy to consult with his successor to get the process started a week sooner  but cmon guysinauguration is 11 12 months away insisting on it now is just plain childish 
0,appoint and nominate do nt mean the same thing 
0,regardless of your liberalconservative views  one of the main reasons supreme court justices have lifetime appointments is so that they may adjudicate  free from political influence this whole debate that is currently raging was never supposed to have occurred in the first place as the nominee is supposed to be someone who is the most qualified for the job in both the eyes of the president and the senate conservative or liberal  it was nt supposed to matter 
0,suppose that the gop wins the presidency but the democrats recapture the senate does anyone really think that if the democrats vote down every nominee for 4 years that the republicans will just say   well  that s just the senate doing their constitutional duty to advise and consent boy this is hard  i hope we can find a reasonable agreement on a suitable replacement   hell no  they would rage out  part of why our political system mostly works in this country is that for over 200 years even bitter rivals have been able to act in a manner which reflects respect for civic duty when that broke down once before  more than 600000 people died to resolve the dispute  if the senate does nt consider nominees to the supreme court in good faith  they risk the entire political system crashing down civil wars have been fought over less than this 
0,whether or not you are a fan of president obama  it is his responsibility to present a nominee to fill the vacancy a full year without even a name provided would be gross negligence on his part  imho there are good  qualified candidates for the position and there are issues that need to be adjudicated without danger of a 44 nondecision

0,actually  we had elections in 2010  2012 and 2014  they resulted in the currently republican held senate  who has to confirm anyone obama might nominate 
0,we also had elections for congress and guess who won those  this is the kind of shit that happens when people only vote for president 
0,the president does not appoint justices he nominates  the senate approves or does nt approve 
0,and we chose who gets to affirm the choice when the senate was won by republicans in 2014 
0,i love how each party gets super butthurt when they are on the  other side of the coin   http  wwwcnsnewscomnewsarticleericscheinerschumer07weshouldnotconfirmanybushnomineesupremecourt   but are absolutely astonished at the disrespect when the same thing happens to them in the future 
0,and we had another in 2014 and we ll have another in 2016 
0,so i m assuming he s going to nominate someone that the senate has already confirmed for another position  eg  judge sri srinivasan  etc   it s hard for the senate to say someone is nt qualified when they just recently confirmed that same person  unanimously   as they did with srinivasan 970 this also makes me think that it s  not  going to be attorney general loretta lynch  since her confirmation was more of a battle  edit   here is a list   https  enwikipediaorgwikilist_of_federal_judges_appointed_by_barack_obama  of federal judges obama has appointed so far during his presidency as you can see  several of them were unanimously confirmed by the senate 
0,it is a better choice for obama to nominate a moderate  sensible pick  if he goes out on a limb  republicans will find it easy to paint the nominee as a crazy activist leftist if it s someone like sri srinivasan or paul watford  that argument is undercut  and obama can hammer the republicans for obstructing someone so obviously qualified  who they have confirmed before  
0, obama says those who say he should leave the nomination to the next president are reading something into the constitution that just is nt there  edit  accidentally double pasted text 
0,that s not really a story  it s more of a promise it s not like he s gon na say he s gon na nominate an unqualified candidate 
0,qualified  undoubtedly  moderate and fairly benign  thus forcing gop hand   we shall see 
0,what i think will happen  obama nominated srinivasan  he gets shot down in the senate on principle  wish obama would fire back with larry lessig and get him in though 
0,warren  biden 
0,if i m hillary clinton  that s fucking scary 
0,thanks for sharing this people are unaware of what kind of movement is happening in the sanders campaign they just keep hearing  he ca nt win  but the reality is out there videos like this packing stadiums millions of individual donations the fight is nt over but clinton is scared and she s pulling out all the old tricks that keep things as the status quo talk to people  let them know 
0,i live in ypsilanti and go to school at emu the people saying this attendance was purely because of how close we are to ann arbor are ridiculous the turn out was crazy i had to work  but my brother went and said it was pretty special

0,thousands across the us line up for every donald trump rally 
0,somebody does nt want to campaign on not doing his job 
0, he advised the president to nominate someone who has  an almost identical resume and capabilities of justice scalia   funny  did nt hear shit like this when they installed uber conservative clarence thomas to replace uber liberal thurgood marshall 
0,i think it is pretty hilarious that this is being referred to as a  conservative seat  on the scotus that s not actually how that works 
0,yeahbut only because he thinks they should nt automatically reject a scalia clone  should obama nominate one 
0,he wo nt be the last to break ranks too many of them are vulnerable in the election to hold the supreme court hostage while they re trying to campaign it would be a talking point at every rally or debate they went to  and it s a damned near impossible position to defend as anything other than   i do nt like obama  so i m preventing the highest court in the land from operating properly 
0, if he puts forth someone that we think is in the mold of president obama  s vision for america  then we  ll use every device available to block that nomination   tillis said he advised the president to nominate someone who has  an almost identical resume and capabilities of justice scalia   wtf  that is just plain stupid  dude  your team lost the election 
0,gt   if he puts forth someone that we think is in the mold of president obama  s vision for america  then we  ll use every device available to block that nomination   tillis said he advised the president to nominate someone who has  an almost identical resume and capabilities of justice scalia  being obstructionist until you get what you want without compromise is still being obstructionist he s not  breaking ranks   he s trying to  sound  reasonable while still being gop kuckoo for coco puffs
0,must not be up for reelection 
0,welp  we ve finally done it  reached the point where a republican politician behaving  normally  is so outside the norm  it s breaking news 
0,gop calling their own tactics obstructionist  what s the temperature in hell right now 
0,the gop is putting their heads on blocks here ideally they get obama to nominate someone moderate then slow play until after the election if the dem wins they ratify obama s nom in a lame duck session if the republican wins they table the whole thing and their guy gets a pick  by outright refusing they open the door to obama not nominating anyone  or nominating a dream liberal who they ca nt support either way they look like the aholes who refused point blank before they knew what the offer was obviously this will be decided by the election  which is a startlingly democratic idea   i know obama should get this pick  but he really does nt have any leverage here  it s a political reality  what they should have done is suggest a dream nominee of their own an idea obama  or any president  could nt support then it s a dirty political fight on both sides and congress can play some offense during election season their is no rule that says they ca nt suggest a nominee 
0,yes  obstruct the nominee let the nominee be another symbol of what republicans have brought to the table over the last 7 years the republican party is a national disgrace 
0, this is not a case of a republican being righteous   http  wwwnewsobservercomnewspoliticsgovernmentarticle60375981html

0,gt  gop lawmaker willing to give us empty lip service 
0,is being obstructionist illegal 
0,how many more do we need  like 4 
0,evidently tillis does nt really understand that it still obstructionism saying you re going to use every device available to block a nomination unless obama picks someone in the mold of scalia or it s just typical gop doublespeak saying his party wo nt be obstructiveas long as they get what they want  assholes man 
0,overblown he s simply giving the logical answer  yeah  we ll listen to him we ll still veto him  but we ll listen first 
0,wow  i was nt expecting the senator to be tillis maybe he s cognizant that he ll probably have a strongly contested election in 2020  because i had him pegged as a bit extreme 
0,they voted for revolutionary change  they got a vetocracy 
0, and there  when i had fallen furthest from the mouth of the cave  when i thought all hope for my rescue had fallen away  there i saw a light a small  flickering light far in the distance it called to me  faintly  but in the echoes of my tomb it might as well have been an orchestra  here here there is hope 
0,really  either he s retiring or he s not up for reelection for a while 
0,it will be very interesting how this whole thing shakes out i saw an article about rand paul saying that obama has a conflict of interest in appointing a sc nominee since many of the cases the scotus will be reviewing are dealing with which powers the president does and does not have obama will pick someone who has similar views to himself  but it will be interesting to see what their thoughts on presidential powers is 
0,and what is this persons name so that we can honor him 
0,sounds more like message refinement than a break from the party 
0,somebody is about to get primaried
0,too many of them are vulnerable in the saturday night massacre 
0,please note tillis is not opposed to senate republicans blocking obama from appointing anyone to be the next supreme court justice tillis is against saying it out loud 
0,where is chuck schumer when you need him ca nt we just filibuster for  oh say  18 months 
0,the  r  s just need to find a guy who uses terms like  jiggery pokery  and  pure applesauce  in legal opinions on a regular basis 
0,it is funny watching a dying party desperately exercise what power they have even if it makes them look like fools and only hurts their cause  btw my comments are related to how childish and foolish the party has acted in the last 5 years or so not saying they are going anywhere long term but it is just crazyness 
0,its also just unwise if they block his pick long enough  he ll just make a recess appointment while they re on one of their many vacations boom  senate oversight bypassed its ugly  but they re playing ugly 
0,is this buzzfeed  wtf is this click bait shit 
0,i feel that a progressive party would be inclusive to conservatives who understand social living and liberals who can fathom rural living the gop and democratic party have spent too much time forcing a false choice  imho 
0, we would strongly prefer you nominate the ghost of antonin scalia 
0, we should consider who obama nominates  but if they are nt exactly who we want based of our political ideology  we will block it  sore fucking losers they need to come back to the real world and realize that moderation and compromise run a government 
0, reads title  wow a pragmatic sane republican  reads article   if he puts forth someone that we think is in the mold of president obama  s vision for america  then we  ll use every device available to block that nomination  annnnnnnnd he s back
0,when i grow up  i want to be a senator so i can fillibuster  obstruct  and delay others from doing their jobs for as long as possible

0,can we take a moment to discuss the picture in the article  i like bernie  but that image has a serious supervillanpracticinghisevillaugh vibe 
0,did nt some prohillary supporters  along with most media  say weeks ago  and for months on end  that even if bernie managed to win iowa and new hampshire that nevada would be his death knell because it had a large minority population and that bernie would nt be able to attract said minority voters  hmmm  oh now it s 80  white  great keep moving that goal post  gt  her staff repeatedly claimed that nevada was as white as the first two early states this was not only risibly false  but a clear sign that she wasn  t just lowering expectations but showing real fear she could lose nevada  february 20th ca nt come soon enough 
0,as a californian who just spent the weekend in nevada  you can tell her campaign there is getting desperate she has an ad in every tv commercial spot i d say the ratio of clinton to sanders ads were about 8  1 the one where she s  spent her life fighting for the childrens   i ve heard at least fifty times

0,and thus  the birth of the tea party

0,so it s a couple of links deep in this article  but if you go into the american gaming association s voter information papers that they actually distributed to gaming workers  they gave trump a yellow  green is considered progaming  red was antigaming  the man currently owns a las vegas hotel and casino and they gave him the same gaming rating as bernie sanders and the only reason they gave sanders a yellow is because  information not available  what an absolute sham the trump name literally is a part of the vegas skyline and this organization is trying to make trump out to be wishywashy on gaming 
0,i love arguing politics with coworkers
0,gt  the group s voter guide would probably pass muster in the precitizens united days  says larry noble  a lawyer for campaign legal center and former general counsel for the federal election commission  so the article is saying that  citizens united  has very little to do with this ability to essentially endorse candidates  before  citizens united   there was nothing wrong with a corporation saying  hillary clinton hates puppies   because the law drew a line at  hillary clinton hates puppies and you should nt vote for her  i m not really sure that makes a huge difference 
0,i ve found it s best to not discuss politics at work  mostly because i m pretty well informed and most people that want to talk politics are nt or worse  they re willfully ignorant 
0,that  casino voter guide   http  bigassetshuffingtonpostcomnvcasinovoterguidepdf  is pure garbage here are some highlights   hillary is designated  opensupportive  of gaming  apparently for paying some recent  lukewarm lip service to casino moguls this is despite her opposition to casinos when she was first lady of arkansas  which is mentioned first in the guide    ben carson is designated  opensupportive   and ted cruz is designated  mixed   but they have the same views  that it s up to individual states whether to allow gambling   cruz apparently loses points for saying the government should nt subsidize casino owners   bernie sanders is designated  mixed   citing  no information available  i suppose they could nt be bothered to make a fiveminute phone call to his campaign before printing up these brochures   donald trump is designated as  mixed   apparently because his atlantic city casinos went bust  along with the rest of ac s local economy   it s mentioned that trump currently operates a hotel on the vegas strip  but no bonus points appear to have been awarded for this 
0,keep just these recent decisions in mind where justice scalia was a part of the 54 majority that could have different outcomes if he is replaced by a democrat president   in a 54 majority limits in mccutcheon v fec  the court invalidated the aggregate contribution limits that were first put in place by the federal election campaign act of 1971   in atamp  t mobility v concepcion  the 54 majority ruled that corporations can effectively mandate arbitration agreements that preclude consumers from bringing class actions to combat fraud and enforce their rights without access to an impartial judge and jury  and without the resources to go it alone in arbitration  people typically abandon their claims and corporate wrongdoers are never held accountable many states enacted consumer protection laws to curtail the pernicious practice of forced arbitration  but in concepcion the supreme court held that such laws are preempted by an old federal statute from 1925 called the federal arbitration act  faa    the 54 majority in michigan v epa overturned epa regulations safeguarding communities from toxic pollution by power plants that causes up to 11000 premature deaths each year essentially  the court  s decision places a premium on businesses  bottom lines over public health and limits the epa  s ability to regulate hazardous air pollutants over the objections of corporate interests   in ledbetter v goodyear tire and rubber co  the 54 court majority made it virtually impossible to bring a claim of longrunning sex or race discrimination in pay under title vii of the 1964 civil rights act  a decision later reversed by a congressional statute a woman had been paid less than her male peers for 20 years and the court stated she had no right to bring a lawsuit for equal pay because she failed to file suit within 180 days of the first discrimination  even though she had no way of learning about the discrimination until years later   in davis v fec  a 54 majority overturned the  millionaire  s amendment   congress  s effort to level the playing field in the political process and reduce the influence of wealth on elections by increasing the contribution limits to candidates facing selffunded opponents   in florence v board of chosen freeholders  the 54 court majority ruled that local officials can stripsearch anyone accused of any crime  even if there is no reason to suspect contraband or concealed weapons  and can not be sued for invasion of privacy   the 54 majority in shelby county v holder overturned a key section of the 1965 voting rights act  making it much harder to protect against discrimination in voting not only did the majority dismissively reject tens of thousands of pages of congressional findings supporting the coverage formula contained in section 4 of the nearlyunanimous 2006 reauthorization of the vra  but the opinion was noted for failing to provide any legal or constitutional rationale for its holding nothing in the text of the constitution was cited to justify the court  s novel decision to strike down the cornerstone of american civil rights law   the 54 majority in leegin creative leather products inc v psks inc overruled a 96yearold rule that had made vertical price fixing per se illegal under federal antitrust law overturning the almost century of antitrust law  the court decided that manufacturers and retailers could sometimes engage in pricefixing in dissent  justice breyer cited studies estimating that this change in law would cost consumers  300 billion a year in increased prices on everyday items   a 53 majority  since justice sotomayor recused herself  in american express co v italian colors restaurant ruled that a smallbusiness owner could not bring an antitrust lawsuit challenging a large corporation  s alleged abuse of its monopoly power  even though  it was claimed  it was that very monopoly power that allowed the corporation to force an agreement to arbitrate and not litigate all complaints against it the court upheld the use of forced arbitration clauses even if it made enforcing federal laws like the sherman act practically impossible in dissent  justice kagan explained that the court  s decision allows   t  he monopolist    to use its monopoly power to insist on a contract effectively depriving its victims of all legal recourse   the 54 majority in burwell v hobby lobby stores  inc decided that forprofit corporations can claim religious rights and can exempt themselves from federal laws requiring them to provide contraceptive coverage to employees the majority also rewrote the religious freedom restoration act  with potentially dangerous consequences for lgbt and other americans   in parents involved in community schools v seattle school district  the 54 court majority prohibited school districts from attempting voluntarily to promote school desegregation through student reassignment plans   in walmart v dukes  approximately one million female walmart employees tried to file a classaction lawsuit over claims of sex bias the 54 decision by the court made it nearly impossible for a class of workers to use for widespread corporate misbehavior that comes in the form of unwritten policies essentially  every worker has to bring their own individual claim  making walmart and other large companies realistically judgment proof to these types of claim   in two 54 decisions  solid waste agency of northern cook county v us army corps of engineers and rapanos v united states  the court effectively took many waterways outside the protection of the clean water act  even though pollution from these waterways can dirty the drinking water of 117 million americans as a result of the court  s decision  1500 major pollution investigations have been halted  and epa actions against water polluters have fallen by 50    in national federation of independent business v sebelius which upheld the patient protection and affordable care act under the taxing power of congress  a 54 majority on the court overturned 70 years of precedent dealing with the commerce clause prior to this case  the court had held that congress has the authority to regulate activities that have a substantial effect on interstate commerce in the area of economic activities   substantial effect  can be found based on the cumulative impact of the activity across the country for example  the supreme court held that congress could use its commerce clause authority to prohibit individuals from cultivating and possessing small amounts of marijuana for personal medicinal use because marijuana is bought and sold in interstate commerce the relationship between health care coverage and the national economy is even stronger and more readily apparent the court had also said that congress could use its commerce power to forbid hotels and restaurants from discriminating based on race  even though their conduct was refusing to engage in commercial activity under an unbroken line of precedents stretching back 70 years  congress has the power to regulate activities that  taken cumulatively  have a substantial effect on interstate commerce people not purchasing health insurance unquestionably has this effect this ruling  if a liberal justice is replaced with someone like scalia  could overturn vast amounts of social programs like medicare and worker protections  on the other hand  occasionally a justice like justice kennedy has sided with the liberal justices to produce 54 decisions that would be in danger if a republican wins the white house and a liberal justice dies or retires while they are in office   in obergefell v hodges  a 54 court majority ruled that the constitution protects the right of samesex couples to marry   a 54 majority in texas department of housing and community affairs v the inclusive communities project upheld the longstanding interpretation of the federal fair housing act to prohibit practices with unjustified discriminatory impact   in massachusetts v epa  a 54 court majority upheld the authority of the epa to regulate greenhouse gases   a 54 majority upheld voterpassed nonpartisan redistricting reform in arizona state legislature v arizona independent redistricting commission   in williamsyulee v the florida bar  a 54 majority upheld a ban on state judicial candidates directly soliciting campaign funds   in boumediene v bush  a 54 majority ruled that prisoners detained in guantanamo can file habeas corpus petitions to challenge their detention   a 54 majority in alabama democratic conference v alabama invalidated a state redistricting scheme that used race to harm minority voters   a 54 majority ruled in favor of workers  rights in csx transportation v mcbride ruling railroads are liable for workers  injuries under federal statute if the railroad was partially responsible for the injury through its negligence

0,the article makes this claim from a voters guide  given to 200k casino employees which details different candidates positions on the gambling industry half of the article  is asking readers for stories from their workplaces  and  from the article   the american gaming association does nt fully embrace its ability  courtesy of citizens united  to endorse candidates the group s voter guide would probably pass muster in the precitizens united days  says larry noble  a lawyer for campaign legal center and former general counsel for the federal election commission  huffington post is making up their own shit to be outraged about at this point 
0,thanks scotus  scalia was bound and determined to interpret  and not create  the law  which in my opinion is shortsighted we need justices that interpret the law but above all protect the democracy 
0,once we rub out the first amendment of the constitution and replace it with the 28th  we will be able to pass laws which prohibit political speech in the workplace 
0,why does the left hate free speech

0,never trust anything from the huffington post or anything resembling it 
0,unions force you to pay dues and then donate the money to nothing but democrats lol  the hypocrisy is comically rampant with the dems these days 
0,hillary s biggest foe in this election is google 
0,the hillary campaign is about hillary becoming president like she deserves it or something like us electing her is just completing some prophecy that hillary has waited her whole life to fulfill she reminds me of frank underwood in house of cards  the sanders campaign is not about giving sanders something  its about sanders giving the country something he doesnt act like we owe him something  he acts like we owe ourselves something 
0,the clinton s are using old scare tactics and smear campaigning from the 90s but with the birth of the internet and quickfact checking  the clintons have destroyed their own campaign more than anyone else has

0,welcome to the information age  where your past words and exploits are but a click away and your facts and arguments that played so well to a captive audience  are disseminated and refuted within 24 hours and before they ve had their chance to sway voters 
0,sometimes i feel like candidates are running their campaigns like the marketing tactics of the early 2000 s are still effective on today s audiences not saying they are immune  but just like movie going audiences demand newer and more impressive things  consumers  especially younger  have grown up under a bombardment of the most sophisticated and fine tuned marketing the world has ever seen sometimes i do nt think most politicians this cycle have really kept up in bernie s case you have a good product but who knows  my state has nt seen it s primary yet so maybe i have nt got to experience the big guns 
0, her backers harp on her experience  but experience only counts if you learn from it  ouch 
0,did anyone else cringe a little bit when hillary named mandela as the foreign leader who would influence her foreign policy then hamhandedly segwayed into how she thinks bernie disrespects obama  it seemed like such a pander to the  mostly black  audience in south carolina that cost her the nomination there in 2008  i was happy that bernie forcefully defended himself there and told her he s supported obama throughout his term but  as a us senator  had a duty to the people to question the president in certain issues that s bernie s commitment to democracy over politics  something hillary does nt get 
0,i think her problem is that her understanding of how to do politics is quintessentially out of date she thinks you trade favors for progress she thinks you identify with people by feigning a common identity most damaging  imo  is that she still thinks of herself as part of an oppressed class all that seems corrupt and fake today 
0,let s dispel with this fiction that the clintons do nt know what they re doing they know exactly what they re doing 
0,nothing is more powerful than an idea whose time has come  this killed hillarys campaign in 2008 as democrats were euphoric over electing the first black president  and undecided  independent voters were leery of the clinton brand and the negatives that come with it  its 2016 wall street greed sucker punched the world to its knees in 2008 young voters are looking at a  still  broken health care system  staggering college loan debt  skyrocketing housing costs  stagnant wages in a time of record corporate profits and trillion dollar cash hoards  and hillary clinton  while repeatedly cashing enormous speaking engagement checks and donations from wall street and big healthcare  pharma  keeps attempting to tell voters that she is the change agent that will fix wall street and healthcare  bernie sanders is like a genie that popped out of the bottle at exactly the right moment in time  who appeals to all the voters put off by clinton for reasons i just mentioned

0,after living in south carolina for a year and keeping in touch with people there  i would nt be ecstatic about this if i were a clinton supporter maybe  i d stick with  clinton is favored by 18 points in  a state    i ve got no hate for sc but  let s be honest  even the progressives there average about 30 years behind the curve of liberal culture 
0,only 40  of likely democratic voters have decided who they are voting for though and only 34  of likely black voters have decided i think that bodes well for bernie who has a much better ground game  source  http  wwwcnncom20160216politicssouthcarolinapollcnnorcindexhtml the part i referred to is near the bottom
0,not too terrible considering clinton was expecting to crush sanders into the dirt in sc just a few weeks ago  sc might actually be a nail biter if he keeps gaining 
0,and this is where clinton is supposed to be strongest  she s plummeted the last 2 months in sc
0,the outcome in nevada will weigh heavily on those who have not decided  about a third of black voters  34   say they have decided on a candidate versus nearly 6 in 10 white voters  57      http  wwwcnncom20160216politicssouthcarolinapollcnnorcindexhtml 
0,i need something explained to me from people in the know  why is sander s support so low among blacks  he has been a civil rights activist for as long as we can find records of him has marched with civil rights leaders of the day has been consistent on all of his platforms  what do blacksminorities know that i do not  where should i be looking for stories to explain this  i need some sources on this please i ca nt find sources to adequately explain this to me 
0,hillary s campaign is essentially 3 vs 1  bill and chelsea are continuously sent out to do hillary s dirty work  sanders campaign can rebuff bill  but rebuffing chelsea would undoubtedly result in the clintons labelling him a sexist creeper  luckily they ve been smart enough to avoid that trap

0,her lead is shrinking every day she will be crushed when it comes time for south carolina they re only a few more days and he is slowly slowly coming up on her i think her campaign is in shambles right now and they re really feeling it we re going to see who the true nominee will be clinton is no queen but we are going to see who s going to be crowned king and i will be bernie sanders he is going to be reckoning that this country needs 
0,why pollsters assume a youge black turnout  according to cnn poll  hillary leading among blacks  6528  meanwhile bernie leads among whites  5440   overall result is 5638  so if turnout ratio is 5050 hillary should lead by 65 points  52546   why in the earth black folks will turnout for hillary more than they did for obama back in 2008 primaries
0,clinton is an unethical fraudster fact 
0,not to say this is nt a good result for hillary it is but the trendlines have got to be worrying for her campaign she had a 31 point lead in october and now it s down to 18 points 40  of democratic voters are still trying to decide  so there s room for a potentially big swing  hillary will very likely win sc but the question is by how much i m expecting a low to mid double digit win for her at this point if sanders can hold her to single digits in sc  that will be big 
0,the number of hillary canvassers positively dwarfs the number of sanders canvassers bernie s online support does nt stretch out to the real world

0,wow this thread is a nightmare
0,gt  debunked this assertion with data showing that fewer than 1 in 10 abortion providers are in majorityblack neighborhoods the black population is largely concentrated into fairly tight areas  and make up less than 12  of the us population it would be interesting to see what percentage of black people as a whole have an abortion clinic in their zip code  zip was what was used in this  study   vs white people  to be a majority black neighborhood there would have to be quite a few black people there since their usage means that black people made up of 50  or more of the neighborhood  it could be 49  black  48  hispanic and they would nt consider it  majority black  
0,social programs do nt lift people out of poverty you do nt even need to be a republican to see that social programs are just to keep people alive and off the streets 
0,does anyone know if conservatives  particularly republicans in the south  have some kind of more subtle agenda  s  beneath the veneer of  prolife  and  limited government   attempts to impede women s access to care in 2016 is so absurd that i often wonder if the motivations are deeper than just ignorancesexismracism  religion  and political ideology the ultimate consequences of interfering with women s health rights are so obviously ass backwards and to the detriment of society it makes my head explode  it would nt surprise me if many of these bastard politicians view such actions as a long term investment in their criminal justice systems and keeping their prisons filled  among other sinister motives  do these states  by chance  happen to reap any federal benefits from rampant populations growth  i know many red states get heavy federal subsidies it feels like there s more to it than concern for the  sanctity of life   perhaps i underestimate racism in the south 
0,funny  the only time i have personally heard the claim that planned parenthood was a conspiracysecret genocide of black people was from a professor that focused on black studies and who was herself black i also got to know a student who looked up to said professor as a mentor they both shared some of the most backwards  fuckedup  blmesque stances i have ever seen  this is not a conservative or liberal issue it s a misinformation issue people either make shit up to get what they want or they never bother finding out what s true or false before spouting shit to get what they want all dishonest sides will pull the same trick they want to break you down into groups so you re easier to control you can put any spin on any issue if you do nt care about the truth  here we see someone making an issue black and white while pretending to want to stop the issue from being black and white it is insane we have reached the point we have in politics everyone is contradicting themselves constantly the truth is the last thing they consider  i think the congresswoman made good points  and a gray stance would not bait as many clicks  but she is feeding the fire in her own way it is hypocritical and exhausting to see every day 
0,i love how people can talk about ethnic minorities ignorantly like they do nt fucking understand what a pregnancy is and what it means to take it to term  i remember a few years ago  political camwhore cory booker tried to live on foodstamps to prove that they were really shitty to be on and did nt do a lot for people when half these politicians are forced to work endlessly for shit hours because they do nt have the money to take time off  pay for constant checkups  carry a growing mass on their belly  gain weight  cut out their vices  smoking  drinking   stave off nausea on a regular basis  and then sit on a hospital bed in pain for multiple hours until they re shitting and their asshole tears and a kid comes out  i ll value their opinion on this as much as the opinions of the women who see what their future and what their fetuses  possible futures could look like  they can also adopt all the kids that are brought to term then given away  too just to be consistent surely that s why most of them are in the top 10

0,i do nt know about the word  target   but i  do  know that if literally anything else had such a disparate impact on the black community  the left would be endlessly crying  racism  but the left is especially good at turning a blind eye when it comes to abortion  cf most prominent democrats  abhorrent views on lateterm abortion  
0,i had a conversation with my father about this i was home a couple of month ago  he was watching fox news as normal  well  some of the blacklivesmatter stuff came up i pointed out that cops usually show up in poorer areas more and generally treat them worse he said  they are nt targetting black people  it is just more crime happens there so of course that is where cops are more prevalent  then like 20 minutes later  brain surgeon grainstorage came on saying that black communities were being targetted by planned parenthood to commit black genocide i pointed out that that they were not in those areas targetting black folk but they were in more poor areas because they have less access to proper health insurance and birth control my father vehemently believed that pp was very racist  i then pointed out that if pp was targetting blacks  why were nt the cops or vice versa  he started ranting about how he did nt want his money to go to poor people and that i did nt know what it was like in the world screamed at me like i was a child  i am a 30 year old man  i have travelled the world  i have a good job but nope  i do nt understand the world

0,i dont want to hear anything from assholes who complain someone  humanized  a fetus http  wwwwashingtontimescomnews2016feb8naralslamsdoritosforhumanizingfetusesinsupe
0,if both sides of the abortion debate spent the money they spend fighting each other on ectogenesis research this entire argument would be over by now and both sides would get what they want  we d live in a society where a woman can remove an unwanted fetus and one where those unwanted fetuses do nt have to be destroyed when removed literally having your cake and eating it too  if you ever have donated to either side of the abortion debate please consider doing some research on ectogenesis and helping fund laboratories working on the technology  if we work at it we could all see a world where sexual intercourse and breeding become entirely disconnected from one another 
0,it is a simple fact that not only are abortion rates higher in countries where it is illegal  but also abortion related health complications and deaths for women increase dramatically in these places whatever your view on life  souls  zygotes being children or whatever it is a fact that making abortions safe and available reduce many immediate atrocious problems in society and the benefits clearly outweigh the cost 
0,what are you doing  bill  
0,i support sanders and it s a valid comparison they are both grassroots movements driven by frustration with the party establishment which are trying to steer the party to a less watered down version of what it claims to support they both have a more raw presentation which ignores the unspoken rules of what is okay to talk about they obviously have differences but from the high level  they are similar 
0,in fairness  before the tea party was coopted by fox news and freedomworks  it actually did have a legitimate grassroots origin which was born of   some   of the similar frustrations that sander s supporters are expressing now in this way the origins are not entirely dissimilar  what   i   think is amusing is that bill clinton is trying to smear sanders by comparing his supporters to a  successful  movement much as people may hate to admit it  the tea party completely changed the political landscape  and not just in dc  so i think the message is clear  folks former president bill clinton is telling sanders supporters that they too can change the entire political landscape   billisaberniebro
0,i do nt think that denigrating sanders supporters will prove to be a winning move for the clintons if hillary s supporters had half the passion as they do her campaign probably would nt be so nervous  in reality  i see huge differences between the sanders movement and the tea party the tea party was manufactured by fox news and freedomworks to serve the establishment s purpose whereas the sanders movement is a true grassroots movement against politics as usual night and day difference 
0,gt  he added that the democratic party is experiencing a pull to the left similar to the extreme right pull exerted on the republican party by the tea party  the irony is that the dnc pulled hard to the right beginning with his second term if anything  i see this is a selfcorrection  in fairness  he never said that sanders supporters are like the tea party  but he did make allusions to that effect  and  before i am blasted  i m a sanders supporter 
0,i know its intended to be a jab  but the tea party has been very effective at getting their vocal minority into a number of local and state positions 
0,more and more  i wonder if bill is not looking forward to living in the white house again  especially if he does nt get to have the oval office  he s been doing his  open mouth  insert foot  routine for a few days now 
0,they say things like this because they are desperate to hold power attack  attack  attack desperate that is the clinton way it s disturbing that anyone would support this family people that desperate for power should never be allowed to have it i ve asked people to explain why they support hillary the answer  because republicans that s it bernie is simply a superior candidate in the face of that truth  you attack and hope something sticks may the entire clinton family fade to a footnote 
0,thanks for lumping me in with the sarah palinmichelle bachmannted cruz sycophants bill 
0,also had interesting words to say about obama in 2008  gt   a few years ago  this guy would have been carrying our bags 
0,i m surprised people are arguing with this  i would ve thought the similarities to the tea party were obvious if anything  bernie is turning out to be more successful than the tea partiers were  he is challenging the party establishment  claiming that they are not representing the interests of a big portion of their constituents  and calling for change their tactics are pretty much the same  only the issues are different 
0,solid move  if your intention is to fuck up at everything 
0,he s not wrong the tea party movement was pretty successful and put people in office 
0,bill clinton started us out on the proverbial road to ruin with his thirdway  republicanlite shit policies  and now his wife wants to finish the job no thanks 
0,fair comparison  bernie supporters are very grass roots  however  i would say they are the antitea party 
0,now now bill  i have nt seen a sanders supporter with  a factually contradictory sign that betrays their lack of understanding of the issues   https  wwwgooglecomsearch  q  keepgovernmentoutofmymedicareamp  biw  1390amp  bih  770amp  source  lnmsamp  tbm  ischamp  sa  xamp  sqi  2amp  ved  0ahukewixiyr12_zkahvesimkhbilacgq_auibigb 
0,he s not wrong just because his last name is clinton  guys  he s 100  right this is absolutely the left s tea party moment 
0,the clintons are berning down their own campaign 
0,the ironic thing is that the democratic party could benefit from having a radical  do this or be primaried  movement willing to push the party to the left and allow the moderates to say  i would pact with you but those crazy people would eat my liver   in parlamentary systems the comunistgreenleftlibertarian parties are the ones doing pushing so the democratic socialist and liberal parties remain honest  it is heartbreaking that the husband of a  progressive  sees the progresive wing of his own party as the enemy  since hillary and bernie  agree  on so many things it must be so hard for her 
0,good at least _someone_ seems to see what s happening  shape up or be fractured  dnc 
0,in a way  bernie supporters are like the tea party citizens who are fed up with status quo party politics organizing to elect individuals that will change their party the difference is ideology 
0,he s not wrong half the people on this subreddit list trump as their second choice for president 
0,this is just crazy  bernie fans are ideological purists  fighting against a democrat in name only  dino   and trying to purge the establishment from dc  the tea party are ideological purists  fighting against a republican in name only  rino   and trying to purge the establishment from dc  big difference 
0,let me say that i certainly hope so  the tea party has completely taken over control of the gop to such an extent that the party establishment can no longer dictate to them with absolute authority  let s also take a moment to remind everyone that the tea party during it s inception was made and built by ron paul and his supporters it was nt until later that the movement was hijacked by a torrent of koch money and became simply an outcry of  boo obama   seeing as bernie s army puts corrupting money at spot  1 as far as problems go that s one we likely wo nt see 
0,whatever anyone thinks of the tea party  it s a simple fact that they ve done a decent job wresting control of their party back from the entrenched corporate interests that were attempting to dominate it or at least they were  and even now there s a weird combination of uneasy alliance vs power struggle going on  if we can do the same on the left  i ll be very happy 
0,i mean  we are both interested in politics i guess 
0,he is correct  in that the fact the tea party was a republican cashroots campaign that took over and radicalized republicans and got them participating in government if this is somehow a bad thing for democrats to emulate then i missed the memo stating the government is a representation of corporate interests and not a representation of the peoples interests  edited for clarity 
0,damnit bill  i thought we were cool 
0,bill is gon na hand this election to bernie 
0,well then it would be wise for democrats to fall in line would nt it  the tea party cost several representatives their jobs and fractured the republican party beyond repair  of course the tea party is just a front for monied interests to cripple the federal government  but i think my point still kind of stands 
0,the clintons seems to think that it matter more that you get something done no matter what the consequences are than to be principled and not pass conservative legislation for the republicans 
0,i make a point to never take anything a serial rapist says seriously  nypd detectiveretired  
0,man  i used to like bill 
0,as a bernie supporter  there s some truth to that  the most rabid of us seem to not give a shit that they re using right wing attack fodder so long as it helps bernie all in the name of  fuck the system   the narrative is in fact being played by the system  it s disheartening really 
0,i compare clinton supporters to republicans like jeb 
0,theres no way thats going to turn voters off of hillary 
0,the tp was and still is a minority of the republican party progressives are damn near half of the democratic party the tp was and still is a group of know nothing bigots who were pissed an african american democrat was elected president their campaign was to take their country backfrom negros and to give every man  woman and child a gun progressives have real issues they stand behind that actually have a real impact on most americans  both financially and socially bill  if you treat us like the tp  we wo nt vote for you it gets worse though many others will be motivated to campaign actively against you you have made a grave mistake unfortunately  by the time your stuck in the 90 s campaign figures it out  it will be to late 
0,at least we do nt betray others 
0,they re literally doing the same shit as in 2008  like they thought obama must have been a fluke and it ll work this time obama was an approaching wave  and it s beginning to crest nothing will stop it  only slow it down  simply because time keeps on going forward and there s a whole generation or two that has more of it left on their side than the other generations do 
0,bill  why are you making me dislike you   why  i always liked bill clinton  thought he was a pretty good president how are comments like this supposed to make me feel 
0,nice try bill  maybe tomorrow s spitball claim will actually stick 
0,he is nt wrong bernie supporters often accuse her of not being a  true progressive   similar to how tea partiers primaried conservatives who they thought were rinos despite agreeing with them on most issues 
0,as far as i can tell they have nt been coopted by billionaires intent on fucking up america just yet 
0,bernie sanders supporters are increasingly becoming a liberal tea party a section of the democratic party unrelenting in its  extreme  principles  complete distrust of the current establishment  and a set of policy proposals which are outside the main stream of the democratic party  e  while bill clinton is trying to smear bernie sanders supporters i m not i just think he happens to be right whether that means sanders  unelectable  or if this is even a concern for his campaign remains to be seen 
0,it s the  third way  centrist obstructionists that impede progress they are those chanting  no we ca nt 
0,bernie sanders is no tea party insurrection

0,bill  you are making a fool of yourself 
0,as if i needed another reason to vote for anyone but hrc in the event bernie does nt win 
0,i did nt think it was possible  but i have less respect for bill with every detrimental comment he spews about bernie and his supporters he should realize he s going to need us if hillary somehow wins the nomination
0,go back to getting your dick sucked  bill
0,okay  bill clinton has jumped the fucking shark 
0,anybody who says  well i guess bills kind of right  the two movements are kind of similar in some respects  is missing the point  while bill is correct hes only trying to make a loaded point in an attempt to discredit the sanders campaign it s transparent rhetoric meant to create a negative association this is alarming because not only is it yet another black mark on clintons unethical campaign and persona  its just stupid politics it alienates voters and further divides a party that wants to win the general incompetence of this level does nt deserve to be rewarded in the internet age 
0,bill is shocked that progressives are trying to pull the democratic party back to the left after him and his third way democrats pulled it to the right  shocker 
0,bill  do yourself a favor  go ask your current intern for teabag 
0,ok  that s it  fuck this guy 
0,i m a big sanders supporter  but you got ta admit this was just clinton being smooth as fuck he sweettalked a curator and offered to pick up some litter so he could bring a date into an empty museum that is god damned romantic and in no way political 
0,somehow i thought this would be about them working in place of strikers  the usual meaning of  cross the picket line  which i did think was an odd choice for s first date for anyone curious here is the full quote  from hillary  around which the article is based ethical or not  your choice  i m just providing the quote for those who do nt feel like clicking  gt  we both had wanted to see a mark rothko exhibit at the yale art gallery but  because of a labor dispute  some of the university s buildings  including the museum  were closed as bill and i walked by  he decided he could get us in if we offered to pick up the litter that had accumulated in the gallery s courtyard watching him talk our way in was the first time i saw his persuasiveness in action we had the entire museum to ourselves we wandered through the galleries talking about rothko and twentiethcentury art i admit to being surprised at his interest in and knowledge of subjects that seemed  at first  unusual for a viking from arkansas we ended up in the museum s courtyard  where i sat in the large lap of henry moore s sculpture drape seated woman while we talked until dark 
0,scabs 
0,the actual story here is pretty neat and only solidifies my affection for bill
0,jesus fucking christ they were nt going in as scab workers bill lied about cleaning up the place to get in so he could have an evening alone with his lady this is like a scene from a shitty romantic comedy  not some insightful view into the clinton s neocon leanings for fucks sake can we concentrate on actual fucking issues and not try to convince each other that america s most prominent family of civil servants is evil because their names are nt bernie and sanders 
0,this is a cool story they did nothing wrong it was a creative way to see some interesting art and  in bill s case  a way to impress the girl you like 
0,so bill clinton  as a college kid  conned his way into a museum and had it all to themselves  but this is now a story about how bill and hillary were scabs  and therefore can now be construed to be secretly antilabor  this fucking sub has lost all sense of perspective 
0,just came here to say bill looks glorious in that photo 
0,the two top posts on rpoliticsrising   on bill and hillary clinton  s first date in 1971  they crossed a picket line   rodham and clinton were offering themselves as replacement labor  blunting  if only temporarily  the effects of the strike on the university   king  amazing archival video appears to show the arrest of a young bernie sanders as a student activist in chicago
0,wow this is hilariously over the top a sweet anecdote about their first date is spun into a tale of antilabor scabs totally totally ridiculous  this hillarybashing is really getting embarrassing for the hillaryhaters 
0,really mods  come the fuck on now 
0,i note that bernie sanders has   never   gone on a date with bill clinton

0,they grow up so fast 
0,i was told to vote for this woman by my union  iam  but i voted for obama and i will vote for bernie this post leaves a really bad taste in my mouth what hypocrite s they are 
0,good for them  it s pretty amazing that people are upset that the clintons picked up litter that the people who were being paid to do so refused to do  it s like many people always say if they feel the compensation for the job is nt fair  quit and find a job that s more in line with what they feel they should be getting  if they ca nt find a job that pays what they think they are worth  perhaps they are overestimating the value of the skills they bring to the table  i m aware this article was submitted as an attack piece  but the story makes bill clinton look awesome 
0,this is in striking contrast to sanders who got arrested on his college campus for protesting segregation practices 
0,how is that a date   
0,i was taught at a young age  under 10  about not crossing a picket line  but i lived in las vegas with some decent unions would the clinton s have been taught that lesson before they were  20 raised elsewhere in the 60 s 
0,well they do nt have to do that anymore now they ll just get 600k for reading off a speech 
0,scabs  who d imagine that 
0,uh  why is this  sorry hillary   the conventional wisdom is that sanders has a more narrow support base  right

0,send the military and the plumbers in rip that water system apart and replace it i know that will still take a while  but the city is in ruined condition major overhaul required
0,perhaps this is a reminder of what may happen when we expand government to do  everything   little considering that taxpayers do nt have enough money for  everything  i wonder what the city  county  and national governments associated with flint have spent on projects over the last 20 years that were less important than replacing lead pipes that bring water into people s homes  or understanding that the chemistry of drinking water is indeed important when lead pipes are still extant you can try to make this a democrat  republican  liberal  conservative issue  but it s really a demonstration of how government systems can go wrong when the servants of the people lose interest in their service  and the people lose sight of demanding government do basic things before it starts doing political things

0,mcconnell did this because he s afraid of the gop base he knows exactly what limbaugh and beck would be saying if he had even feigned reasonableness the base would be up in arms if they thought for even a moment that the establishment would consider letting obama replace scalia he s stuck between a rock and a hard place 
0,it s bad politics  but unfortunately it s almost requisite in a destructive groupthink environment like the modern republican party if you do nt pretend to treat the talking points as gospel and reject compromise like a baptist rejects satan  you re rejected from the group when people make decisions based on fear of reprisal  they re being bullied those republicans who make blind pledges to block anything the president wants  they re being bullied by their own party  and they re caving to the pressure i do nt mean to say the victims of this bullying are nt in some ways complicit i m saying they re cowards

0,there is certainly an age gap going on here it seems as if the only retort that hillary supporters can muster is  young people are too naive to know that they should support clinton  this seems similar to their other arguments  eg  women who support bernie are not real feminists  men who support bernie are sexist  berniebros    considering the incredible skill that young people have in accessing good and relativelyunbiased information quickly using modern technology  the position that young people are naive or underinformed seems to fall flat considering older generations  reliance on outdated information media technologies for their information  media that is largely controlled by corporate clinton supporters  it may be that it is the older generation of voters who are both naive and underinformed  i d like to hear other people s thoughts on this

0,this  and another article  really describe to me the difference between clintonera thought and sanders thought clinton economics is to have unfettered capitalist coupled with biggovernment welfare in the form of transfer payments to those harmed by capitalism sanders favors a more fair form of capitalism that is restrained  designed to not allow people to become billionaires instead of transfer payments funded by taxes  he would rather see more opportunities with their cost baked into the pricing of goods and services  i prefer the sanders approach because it is tenable everyone hates high taxes to fund welfare payments it is better to put more people to work with an economy that is designed to do this rather than one designed to make a few people insanely rich

0,if the teachers union did a better job  then they would nt have to make the government force people to be members this means they have zero accountability to their members  which leads to the kind of teachers union waste and corruption we have here in chicago 
0,yeah those teacher unions are so great they are just awesome at making education better

0,no one is saying he does nt have an impressive record  they re saying his plans for the future are unrealistic blustering about how great his record is does nt make his plans any more feasible the right is much closer to a political revolution than the left  we re running interference this time around
0,whether im in one of my libertarian moods or proconsumer liberal moods  im proud to always disagree with paul krugman 
0,i think that krugman simply fails to see what s happening  that sleepy america is gradually waking up to the fact that its system of government is badly broken and has to change krugman is a very smart economist  but he s looking at things through the prism of  business as usual  bernie s underlying premise is that  business as usual  has failed government needs to change  and he is leading the call for change it is about  the will of the people 
0,sanders clearly has  happy dreams   why else would he pay his interns less than the  15hour minimum wage he wants to force on the country 
0,to be fair  krugman s a staunch neoliberal so of course he s going to speak out against bernie s economic plans
0,to be fair  krugman is sort of a dumb guy

0,so much innuendo so little facts why so coy  if you got something tell us this article is almost meta it s an article about how the writer might go get the sources and facts needed to write an actual article 
0,what a ridiculous piece of agitprop how hard have republicans tried over the years to get one of these laughable scandals to stick  i d at least like to see some originality this time around remember when she was accused of murdering vince foster  then when the obvious lack of evidence became undeniable it simply became another part of the elaborate conspiracy what is more believable  that no plausible reason for indictment exists or hilary is some kind of cartoonish supervillain who acts with impunity and controls the free world from the shadows  if you believe the latter  please also explain why she would want to run for president since she obviously has everything figured out already 
0,man the ny post really has it in for hillary 
0,it s the post never trust the post i do nt even like hillary clinton  but if you guys are at the point where the new york post  a murdoch owned tabloid  is considered a legitimate news source on clinton then there is something seriously wrong with you guys they ve been publishing unsubstantiated hit pieces against her for over 20 years  they are nt exactly unbiased 
0,this rpolitics browbeating is becoming really grating 
0,republicans were saying this about whitewater and cattle futures and travelgate over 20 years ago 
0,berine supporter here just came in to say   ny post  lol 
0,lolor it might just mean that  despite a concerted effort for 30 years to connect her from everything from murder to drug running  these are nt real issues 
0,it  might  also be reasonable to conclude that her not having been indicted is a sign she has nt broken any laws  you know  if you re posting fox news and ny post articles in support of your cause  it might be time to evaluate your course 
0,uhh i have a great idea  let s get ken starr back and give him unlimited power and tons of money to investigate endlessly and if he takes long enough maybe she will get caught having sex with an intern and all the little trolls can say  see i told you so  we always knew she did something  we just had to wait long enough for her to actually do it  gotcha  she s not my first choice for president but if she s so damn good at getting away with all the stuff she s been accused of for 30 years  then maybe she d make a tough and crafty president  in her absence i would nominate the following paragons of virtue  bob livingston  tom delay denny hastert scooter libby newt gingrich irancontra etcetc  yo investigate this  shit happens on both sides of the aisle but since the day bill clinton announced his first run for president  the republicans have redefined the term  witch hunt  if they were half as obsessive about fixing things  we d all be living in the  real  america we all deserve
0,hillary clinton has never broken a law is that the kind of person you want for president 
0,its weird to me that this is pretty high on rall but the comments unanimously think its bullshit 
0,oh my god the republicans used to be the worst when it came to slandering other candidates  but the democrats have now taken the cake 
0,this article is a pure piece of innuendo in which the only source cited by the author are previous writings by the author  and yet hillary haters will inglorious that to spin a tale  just as the author does
0,imagine how much praise rpolitics would be raining upon this woman if bernie was nt running 
0,yawn there have been stories like this promoted by the right wing nut jobs for decades  not years  decades from arkancide to benghazi the republicans have been spouting bullshit lies about hillary forever lies  lies  lies 
0,when bush  cheney  etc  are in jail for war crimes  then we can talk

0,have you guys gone so far left that you now find yourselves in the company of the ny post  whats next  everyone in here starts watching fox news 
0,taxpayers spent millions of dollars investigating the clintons and turned up not a whit of truth of the right wing conspiracies 
0,while i of course like the title  we should probably disregard nypost articles 
0,i ca nt pinpoint if but something looks different about herhttp  imgurcomkqgo1jr
0,maybe the author of this article could show an example of a crime worthy of indictment  and why hillary was nt prosecuted for it  seems to me there s ample political will to prosecute the clinton s for any wrongdoing from the right  so if there s sufficient evidence out there  why is nt it being acted upon  just reporting that other people say there s wrongdoing worthy of prosecution is nt  evidence  of anything other than what that person claimed if ken starr has evidence that a crime was committed twenty years ago  what s he been waiting for 
0,you know  if you re posting fox news and generating discussion and opinions based on faulty information 
0,it s so nice having the sense to just sit back and let things play out being defensive is contagious apparently  its so fun watching people clammer over each other to piss the hardest into the wind 
0,nypost doe  boo this man   
0,like that republican nixon not getting indicted 
0,you know  if you re posting fox news and ny post really has it in for hillary 
0,heh i just posted a similar sentiment in another thread before i even read this yes  its opinion but it makes me feel good that im not alone in seeing how hillary is the symbol for so many aspects of our country that are broken its also nice to see that more and more people are beginning to wake up to these concepts hillary is hardpressed to convince voters that she ll fix the very systemic problems that created her

0,thank allah for donald trump 
0,i do not like hillary clinton but this shit is so fucking weak she is not riding on the coattails of her family she is not from a political family she and bill formed a partnership without this marriage does bill clinton ever become president  i do nt believe so hillary is not bill s child she is her own person a person who has worked hard to get where she is now stop equating her with the bushies there is no clinton dynasty at least not yet

0,tbh i m much more concerned about the bushes than i am about hillary  they exemplified privilege and had their careers completely supported by their network  hillary has at least worked for it 
0,how close can the bush brothers be  they do nt even have the same accent 
0,did we just get punked by the british   
0,and in a country that threw off kings and queens and inherited nobility  they can both shove it 
0,do nt forget bernie s uncle  colonel 
0,this is nt the same thing bill and hillary are married i assume probably met doing something politically active  and they grew together and nurtured each other s careers it s not surprising that both of them would dedicate their lives to politics and potentially both reach the top  the bushes  on the other hand  are related by blood  not by common interest in that case it s more like a hereditary ruler  what the op means by  close family member 
0,let s be real  george washington would be sickened by this bullshit the man left office after two terms for a reason 
0,eli5  we specifically wrote into the system that a president ca nt serve more than two terms and that after those terms they re still ineligibleforlife for several nonpresidential positions  why is nt there anything about a single familybloodline being ineligible for at least a decent handful of generations after holding the office  it seems like the exact thing that would have been on the founders minds considering they were separating themselves from a country using a monarchy 
0,our government has basically been a twofamily system  not just a twoparty system it shows how undemocratic our democracy really is 
0,the south is proving to be just as incestuous as ever 
0,sanders straight up said that if warren does nt run  or another progressive  that he would run no one stepped into the race so he did 
0,and i think 99  of bernie sanders  supporters would be just as happy  if not happier  with warren 
0,i believe they probably have discussed this between the two of them and decided that bernie would run for whatever reasons 
0,most bernie supporters wanted her first it is not that they do nt want hillary because she is a woman  they do nt want her because she is calculating rather than principled  opportunistic as opposed to moral 
0,he s going to make her secretary of the treasury  hopefully 
0,if sanders loses this election  she will win in 2020 by a 51 margin 
0,if she ran she would have won 
0,please give bernie some credit for daring this  radical  campaign   i do nt think it was an battle to lose to begin with and it is nt now i admire his courage more 
0,i knew and loved warren before i ever heard of sanders  but i think he has a better chance than warren would ve while he has the age and jewish thing against him  warren has almost no history in politics compared to clinton  elected to senate in 2013  and the difference would ve been far starker 
0,actually  i think she did nt run  because he is they re definitely similar  and i would like to see her do big things in years to come i think they re paving the way for each other to make revolutionary changes she makes me so proud to be form massachusetts 
0,warren is most effective in the senate 
0,i love warren for the same reason i love sandersunvarnished straight talk that is both believable and not self serving both of them are people i would want to be friends with because i feel i could call them when facing a difficult decision or moral dilemma and get some advice that would likely solve the problem  i feel that clinton would give me advice she could either profit from or use against me in the future 
0,sanderswarren 2016 
0,i m not sure she would have a chance against clinton though the reason bernie has been so effective is because of his recordrhetoric she does nt have the record 
0, great men do not seek power they have power thrust upon them 
0,please  please  i beseech you all  stop with the vp talk it will not happen and should not happen warren far more valuable and powerful in the senate 
0,alright  i got ta jump in here i know that most of reddit absolutely loves warren  but she is just as big of a politico as clinton or rubio i m from a small suburb of boston  and i guarantee if you mentioned it to her  she would nt know where it is she does nt do much  in my opinion  for the commonwealth she represents  opting instead to work for national causes  she s a carpet bagging technocrat from harvard law who was crowned  just like clinton  by the dnc amp  dccc to take ted kennedy s seat back from scott brown  who won it by beating the last anointed ma senate candidate  martha coakley  who was acting like hrc is now when she was campaigning  like she inherited the job   i know on the national stage she is a progressive hero  but as somebody she is supposed to represent right now  i feel that she is using massachusetts like so many other aspirational politicians  patrick  romney  brown  callahan  etc   stepping on our heads on the way to dc 
0,warren for vp 
0,i m really hoping sanders picks her as a running mate  if she d accept   she s a fabulous politician though having her in the senate may allow her to affect more 
0,warren for vp  sanders  warren 2016
0,if he would pick her for vp i d lose it that s the dream team 
0,could there be a sanderswarren ticket 
0,was nt sanders recruited to run by the people who started the draft warren group after she firmly declined to run 
0,i would bet that if bernie wins the nomination warren will be top choice for vpgiven bernie s age it would be a coup if she accepted 
0,i identify as a pretty middleoftheroad independent  socially liberal  fiscally conservative  and i d feel a hell of a lot better voting for warren than sanders 
0,in what world does clinton s remark at the end make sense  you ca nt criticise the current president because you re in the same party  does she really expect that kind of partisanship  does she think it s a good thing 
0,bernie is only running because elizabeth did nt 
0,i have nt looked in a while but it seems as these two are very compatible as politicians maybe they could go as running mates 
0,ever consider that maybe elizabeth warren did nt run because bernie was going to run 
0, if thing that did not happen had happened  then other thing that did happen might not have happened  great reporting 
0,i recall bill maher offering her 1 million dollars if she ran 
0,sometimes  deficit spending is a democratic socialist 
0,i thought the bill press interview was super interesting is it possible to get a link for the full version 
0,she might get nominated for the scotus vacancy 
0,there were a ton of people who should have run  but did nt bother because the process seemed set up for hillary to win who saw kerryedwards coming in 2004  historically way more people on both sides have been willing to give it a shot and see how it goes  turning the nominating process into hillary s coronation was a huge mistake 
0,i was all in for warren  signed the petition to ask her to run she said no and we got bernie happy with either one
0,elizabeth warren is the goldman sach s wolf in sheep s clothing do nt buy into her bullshit 
0,i ve been a bernie fan since he arrived in congress in 1991 but i would have been perfectly happy with warren as a candidate she s better known and bernie did not want to run i listened to the onceaweek brunch with bernie hour on the thom hartmann radio show and bernie kept hoping a progressive like warren would run when no one came forward  he began talking about running himself 
0,so sanders runs because he feels he must  that the country needs his policies and pretty much every other candidate in either party runs because of personal ambition 
0,gt  trump not only pointed out that bush was president on 911 and that the attacks that day count toward his final grade  but he also noted that bush failed to heed intelligence warnings about the pending attack and that his administration lied to the public about weapons of mass destruction in iraq  all of which is common knowledge to the rest of us  but republican political orthodoxy forbids these things from being mentioned aloud trump is just being true to his distaste for political correctness 
0,note  article title is irony
0,pfffffffft    what a maroon  s
0,imagine if an attack with that magnitude happened when obama was president 
0,15 years later  seems obvious that they let 911 happen to pursue their agenda and military goals  or i am insane  i guess and it s all just coincidence 
0,why do republicans continue to defend the failure that was the george w bush presidency
0,bush was president during 911 though 
0,i m pretty sure dick cheney was president on 911 
0,you know the gop  is doomed when fuckface von clownstick is making sense   actually we are all doomed
0,http  wwwmotherjonescompolitics201505youngberniesanderslibertyunionvermont
0,i hate that i am effectively defending bush  but there was a few hours worth of attacks on us soil during his presidency if that s the totality of the war waged against us during his term  there is an argument that he kept us fairly safe 
0,this should be trump s theme song wherever he goes  https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  trujr8evgbg
0,protestors literally make trump stronger 
0,this was actually pretty awesome and holy crap  trump was right  the press wo nt mention or talk about all the terrible foul language the protester used against everyone and how she started swinging at everyone calling it now  tonight or tomorrow headline stories of  trump brings rally members to the stage to praise them for manhandling tiny female protester with excessive force

0,trump is the best
0,alright   sniff   who s cutting all the onions around here 
0,this is great  what a bunch of high energy individuals who want to see their country become great again  there s an authenticity in these men and their support for trump that i do nt think any of the other candidates  besides bernie  are even close to and it speaks to trump s character  to let them come and take the mic  and show us the viewer  that trump is real  he inspires  and he s a genuine guy that truly believes in the messages he preaches  and wants to improve the lives of the average american citizen 
0,i was genuinely moved by their words i hope the video goes viral so people can see the hope that trump inspires in his fellow americans 
0,saw this live on the youtube live stream the chat was extremely excited about it 
0,that was pretty amazing
0,he brings up two random supporters to speak for him at a rally that s amazing one is a vet and the crowd went wild cheering  usa usa usa  we need this in america again

0,those guys had really nice sweaters 
0,is there a nonyt source of this video  i m at work right now and yt is blocked 
0,i see the paid trump whores have arrived 
0,holy shit  what in the fuck is going on here  first of all  this video seems suspicious these guys were way too comfortable with public speaking that s literally the  1 ranked fear  over  death   and these guys were nt shook in the slightest they each had concise  thoughtout statements to make when put on the spot they independently represented different portions of the constituency feels like a planned viral event  and then i come in the comments here and it is jampacked with glowing commendations of trump no one s really talking about the protester  or the two guys just a whole lot of  wow trump is great  he has balls to let them do that    is this how trump plans to sway middle america  are we being marketed to 
0,all this is doing is encouraging simpleminded trump supporters to attack protestors in the hopes they ll get the opportunity to meet their phony hero i ca nt wait to watch trump get trounced in the general  fueled specifically by votes from the very people he denigrates 
0,holy shit take that tobacco out of your mouth when you speak
0,so far we have two comments in support of trump and his  tremendous amazingness   strange how both accounts are only hours old 
0,get a load of all the credulous rubes in this thread whoo boy 
0,yep  the constitution is clear  the president nominates people  senate has to approve them if they ca nt agree  no progress is made why are both sides having such a struggle with this 
0,interesting look at history  kerry on his filibuster http  wwwnytimescom20060127politicspoliticsspecial127alitohtml gt   people can say all they want that elections have consequences   he wrote  trust me  more than anyone i understand that but that seems like an awfully convoluted rationale for me to stay silent about judge alito s nomination  gt   the president has every right to nominate samuel alito to the supreme court   mr kerry said  it s our right and our responsibility to oppose him vigorously 
0,gt  when asked by a reporter about his own support of a filibuster of justice samuel alito  then a nominee of president george w bush  obama shot back that  justice alito is on the bench right now  so its okay because he ultimately failed got it 
0,obama only follows the constitution when it suits him 
0,hey the constitution is  pretty clear  on gun rights and the right to privacy but i guess those slipped by him 
0,i would be shocked if bernie wins sc
0,i think sanders will win nevada  but the polling in south carolina sets up a seemingly insurmountable gap no way he wins in sc 
0,ah yes  the reputable  lifezette 
0,if bernie wins sc  its over for hillary
0,nevada that would be closer to an upset  but even then they ve polled closely for a while now  even going back prior to iowa and nh sanders only polled behind by what  9 points or something  i firmly believe sanders will win nevada  now  if sanders wins sc  that would be an upset 
0,kinda like she was out voted in nh 
0,a good ground game can only go so far  ie ron paul in 2012 
0,article is so wrong trump is nt against free trade he s only saying that free trade should go both ways he wants to pressure china  japan  mexico  etc to open up trade on their side instead of taxing our goods to oblivion and manipulating their currency 
0,i just wanted to point out that the thumbnail is goatse
0,if you re open minded to the opinions of rightwingers  i suggest reading  this   http  wwwdailywirecomnews3280sandersandtrumparesametotalitariancandidatebenshapiro   its interesting 
0,they offer the same variation of the time tested outsider vs insider rhetoric that got every president elected since the early 90s  in 2008  it was hillary the beltway insider vs obama the political outsider  in 2000  george bush was the real american  down to earth folk that gets hardworking citizens  in 1992  bill clinton was the american dream he pulled himself from poverty up to the hallowed halls  and earned his way into yale law  now in 2016  we have two candidates who tapped into that same vein and using that rhetoric to get into power it is empty promises and platitudes that amount to nothing when they have to deal with people who disagree with them on a fundamental level 
0,i seriously do nt know how people voted for trump and believed he was the best guy for the job 
0, trump loves capitalism and the stuffed crust pizza it brings into our lives   http  iimgurcomn4pozfsgifv 
0,i legitimately ca nt decide which political move is more out of touch with reality  1 hillary boasting about having henry kissenger s support  2 jeb using george w on the campaign trail  it s madness it s absolute madness 
0,so this is just jeb s final hail mary move  right 
0,the other night trump was met which a chorus of boos for daring to challenge the conservative spin that  george w kept our country safe  trump pointed out that 911 occurred during the bush regime  despite warnings from the cia that this attack was imminent in a report titled   osama bin laden destined to strike in the united states  or something like that  trump also pointed out that bush s destabilizing influence is what created isis and emboldened terrorists in that destabilized region  which is also tantamount to not exactly keeping us safe  the howl of horrified boos from the audience was amazing  as though each of them was drinking the same koolaid
0,the really sad thing is that w looks like winston churchill compared to current crop of gop candidates
0,we need to dispel this notion that jeb bush knows what he s doing jeb bush has no fucking clue what he is doing 
0,jeb needs to get his mommy to help him campaign  and when that does nt work he calls in his brother who is nationally regarded as responsible for many of the problems we face as a country today  please clap

0,remember w was handed a surplus in 2001 and squandered it with incredibly irresponsible tax cuts during time of war the us is the only country in the history of the world to cut taxes during time of war conservatives have no standing to complain about the national debt because largely they caused it  now that we are in the paul ryan era  the budget deficit and national debt any more is absolutely intentional because they will use it to justify cuts in social security and medicare and anything else that does nt benefit the 1   it s the grover norquist method

0,the dnc is in a tight spot they ve put a lot of time  money  and effort into clinton  and are now increasingly willing to send good money after bad if they think that there s still a chance that they can pull clinton out of her nosedive to get her the nomination  they can similarly delude themselves into thinking that  by the general  the email thing will have blown over  especially if clinton herself has not been candid with the democratic leadership about what was on that system because  she  believes that they will have no choice but to back her if she can get the nomination  do nt operate under the assumption that just because the dnc establishment wants hillary as the nominee and hillary wants the support of the dnc that either trusts the other  honestly  one of the more damning things for clinton was the house gop taking a step back and just saying   you know what  we think the fbi s got this covered

0,ok guys  i love bernie but this is a random unscientific online poll that is about as meaningful as a poll of reddit users 
0,that reads like a proclinton push poll it did nt even ask about which candidate they d support  luckily it was nt a telephone survey  although pushpolling by telephone is also a thing  it s taking things pretty far  even for an unscientific survey  gt  1  sanders could be elected as president in november  as americans reject concerns over his identity as a  democratic socialist  okay  strong opening  gt  2  clinton is a betterqualified candidate because of her experience as the wife of a president  a senator and secretary of state  oh dear  if you were expecting a question here also regaling sanders  past career and marital status  you d be mistaken  gt  3  both candidates are actively vying for the votes of africanamericans those voters have better reasons to support  okay  without controlling for demographics  this does nt mean _anything_ gt  4  it is important to me that clinton be elected this year as the first woman president in us history  oh my 
0,i do nt know why clinton and her campaign believes that the south is going to be a safe haven for her  you see  the thing about southern democrats is that they share alot of thoughts and feelings with southern republicans that live all around them  every day  for their entire lives  if you keep on hearing and seeing people talk about how much they hate hillary clinton as southern democrats do when they re around southern republicans  some of that will eventually seep in

0,one problem that will need to be addressed before even mr sanders  economic prescriptions can work  our currency is overloaded  in a computer program  if the programmer tries to do too many things with one variable  the result is sure failure humans overload their currencies in the same way and to the same result  they try to make their currencies do too many things at the same time a medium of exchange  a medium of wealth storage  a means of demonstrating success  etc this can be fixed by using specific currencies for specific things  a saving currency  a trading currency  an investment currency  etc make tax policies specific to the uses of the various currencies and to their conversions from one type to another this would require secure electronic currencies  on a related note  what is a good way to really screw up a government  hoard their currency or otherwise take it out of circulation  the us and other governments are experiencing this now as multinational corporations stash currencies in outofreach banks governments are foolish to allow these people  aka  corporations   to undermine their currencies in this manner

0,disclaimer  i think obama should nominate someone  and the senate should hold confirmation hearings but this article does not accurately describe most republicans  statements on this issue  the vast majority of republican statements  although  notably  not the cruz one cited in the article  carefully phrase the issue as whether a nominee has been  nominated and confirmed  in the president s last year in office  although kennedy was confirmed in 1988  he was nominated by reagan at the end of 1987  so he does nt fall under this definition

0,kennedy having been nominated in 1987 to fill a vacancy created in 1987 a vacancy extended due to the rejection of robert bork for purely ideological reasons  got ta suspect a lot of rs remember that their sc nominees since bork almost always get hassled and delayed but the dem nominees got free rides this time around  why should they let a judge on the court that ll put a liberal majority on the court  it s not dems are gon na just let a president cruz appoint a conservative to replace ginsburg  this has all been building up for years since the dems stopped robert bork 
0,it s been a talking point so testing companies can make money it s also an aspect of dog whistle politics and implicitly and explicitly divisive  it encourages an  us vs them  towards people who are struggling

0,we did nt want obama to approach this job as a cynic  by now he has earned it while most have gotten frustrated watching it  this has been his entire waking life for over 7 years i would like to hear his commentaries of the process once he no longer has to keep decorum  this likely wo nt change  no matter who gets in each and every presidential contender left has pissed off a large number of people within the gop trump  rubio  jeb  and cruz are just as likely to be labeled the antichrist as sanders and hillary

0,dragging ass is only going to hurt the republicans with moderates and undecideds in the general election 
0,man those checks and balances of power in the constitution are a real downer 
0,this is a consequence of changing how the senators are elected it used to be that the house of representatives  and to some extent it is still called this   called the  people s house  basically  the senators used to be appointed by the states  and that was changed in the early part of last century  which puts a different kind of pressure on the senators to be as partisan as the house has always been 
0,we ve almost become accustomed to how obstructionist both parties can be with us stuck in the middle if only there were third parties and better voting systems to more accurately represent us 
0,we have three branches in order to separate powers this is part of it people act like this is something new the legislative branch  republican  is going to fight to leverage power from the executive branch  democrat  by trying to get more conservatives into the judicial branch a democratcontrolled senate would do the same to a republican president if roles were flipped and rbg s spot became available 
0,i m probably going to be shouted down for this  but i have to say  it s not congress s job to enable the president s agenda it is rather the president s job to faithfully execute the laws congress passes  if it decides to pass any so  yes  they ve obstructed his goals in office  but that s their prerogative likewise  while you and i may dislike it  if congress decides to attempt to hamper his goals in whatever ways its powers allow it to  that s part of the checks and balances present in the constitution  there s no clause in there saying   but if congress  really  wo nt play ball and you  really  want to do something  ignore them and do it anyway  that being said  he is free to tell them they are assholes if he wishes  honestly  i m happy to see a relatively inactive congress the us code is long enough

0,if the campaigns are nt allowed to coordinate with the super pacs  then how could clinton even tell them to stop advertising 
0,well  if elected  she d be really  really tough on them  you ll see  really  really tough trust her

0,throughout time the most powerful people have been   bankers  people who own natural resources and means of production they have been fighting since the beginning of government regulation the left is funded by the banks  gs  lehman bros  chase  etc  and the right is funded largely by oil executives  we should just get rid of private banking 
0,she always says to point to examples where she gave out favors  but is nt the _lack_ of doing anything really a favor  sanders always points out how nobody has gone to jail after the crash  and they also happened to spend millions of dollars in dc as well

0,has anyone in the media called them out on this hypocrisy  first they said they were nt working with a superpac  a lie  they re coordinating with correct the record superpac  one of her at least 3 superpacs   secondly  they said the superpacs were to only help in the general election against the republicans and make a level playing field except now they re unleashed against bernie

0,gt  bernie is a problem hillary can  t figure out how to solve  perhaps because he  s not the problem she is   damn  usa today tell us how you really feel   edit   kristen powers  the author of the article  was a member of the clinton organization near the beginning of her career she has since been firm in her support of universal health care and immigration reform  including a path to citizenship however  her stance on social policies are less obvious it s unclear who she supports it s only clear that she has a strong dislike for the clintons 
0,to me  hillary appears to be a government employee looking for the promotion she feels she earned  contrarily  bernie appears to me to be a civil servant seeking to serve a larger electorate  such perspectives will naturally guide campaigns 
0,most recently  hillary seems to be making her platform   i m just like bernie  but i can actually succeed   which feels increasingly desperate 
0,gt  the new york times reported that clinton  s flailing campaign is trying out a new line  that   sanders is a  onenote  candidate who is captive to an  obsession  with wall street and campaign spending   clinton is determined to prove that sanders is not ready for office  but that she is    if we broke up the big banks tomorrow   clinton asked a group of union members   would that end racism  would that end sexism  would that end discrimination against the lgbt community     so is hillary s main campaign platform  ending racism and sexism  i thought a campaign on ending corruption in government due to big money and handing back power to the american people would be a better idea  gt  just so we  re clear  sanders is an unserious pieinthesky candidate because he wants to rein in campaign spending and institute a health care system that is commonplace in europe clinton  on the other hand  will eradicate sexism and racism in america who  s the dreamer here  after all  clinton can  t even keep her own campaign surrogates  gloria steinem and madeleine albright  from taking sexist swipes at young female bernie supporters  yup  there s this weird argument that bernie s ideas are fantasy and can not happen   even though plenty of other countries have already done it   http  iimgurcomtwl5nkppng   they ll use lines like  usa is bigger and more diverse or congressional obstructionism will prevent any of bernie s policies from happening  as if hillary would fare better with that reasoning   gt  clinton  s attack is  not surprisingly  dishonest  i think most here will agree with this last statement 
0,back when hillary ran against obama  i remember thinking that she would make a better president than obama  but that she could never win a general election i do nt remember disliking her  even when she went a bit negative  this year it s a bit different i still believe she is absolutely incapable of winning a general election the republicans just hate her too much the base will come out to vote against her  even if they wo nt come out to support trump or cruz or whatever empty suit they nominate  but this year  i m finding myself really disliking clinton on so many counts  her platform simply wo nt solve our problems her motives are clearly all about hillary her rhetoric is so crafted to mislead she s attacking a guy who has refused to attack her back  hillary is pretending to steal bernie s issues  without having the decency to actually do so she offers weaker versions of his plans  but claims they are stronger and she uses cheap rhetorical tricks to obfuscate the differences between her plans and bernies it s not a battle of ideas for her it s just manipulation and taking advantage of the confusion she s deliberately causing  she s clearly taken too much money from too many special interests to ever be impartial  let alone tough on their industries  worst of all is her condescending tone when speaking to young people she refuses to acknowledge their problems  and does nt seem at all interested in actually courting them she does nt think their votes matter she s sure they ll stay home i would nt mind all this if her actual platform and agenda was going to improve their lives but it wo nt  because has no understanding of their problems  i just ca nt vote for hillary i just ca nt she s a bad  bad candidate she will be a terrible president  i might get out and vote against donald trump getting the nuclear codes  if it comes to that but i m praying bernie pulls off the upset 
0,hillary essentially wants to maintain the status quo  which is nt exactly a great campaign slogan when so many people are alienated by the current political system 
0,can we please have more substantive discussions on why bernie sanders  ideas are the best ideas  i tend to agree with him  but at this point we have pretty much saturated reddit with these posts link to econometric articles  or tax policy articles  etc 
0,how is this title allowed 
0,in a way  this is how government is supposed to work  she s going to change her stance to represent the will of the people in order to win the election  because the election system essentially demands that  what i m concerned with is which ideals politicians will pander to  when politicians say that they think pp will make partial birth abortions mandated for all people  i want to hate that politician and their voters  when politicians say that they think gay marriage should be legal  but they did nt think that before  of course i m going to be suspect of their opinion but i am glad that they changed their mind to that stance  and i m glad the voters put that pressure on 
0,till date no hillary supporter has been able to tell me what her agenda is and why she wants to be president
0,fuck s sake people  i m a bernie fan and have never liked hillary  but this is getting absurd 5600 upvotes for an essay that offers absolutely nothing new of substance  and is just a retread of an established talking point for the past two months 
0,i know rpolitics is probernie  and i have yet to make up my mind however  that title makes me cringe  especially since the article linked is nt titled that way 
0,in light of scalia s passing  hillary has been doubling down on her claim that she is the more  electable  of the two yet  when those who value trustworthiness flock to bernie s side  by 91  to 5   even that claim is dubious

0, i m not a one issue candidate because we are not a one issue country  misses the mark money in politics is the issue how can you have an honest conversation about any other issue when special interest groups hold sway over the political system and people s interests  she s nibbling at the edges and bernie is going straight for the heart

0,but how will this cure racism  s
0,the fact that senate republicans will attempt to block an obama nominee is no surprise what is surprising is the assertion that he should nt even attempt to replace justice scalia  even though he has nearly a year left in office it s as though somehow that would be unseemly to leave the supreme court without a tie breaking vote until 2017 is not in the best interest of the country 
0,this is literally one of the things i specifically voted for 
0,gt  senate inaction likely means the court will be without one justice for two terms the next supreme court term will be nearly half over when the next president is sworn in  and even if that president nominates quickly  confirmation is unlikely before the term  s end that means two years of potential 44 deadlocks that leave the court unable to decide major constitutional issues thus refusing to even vote on a nominee is not just an abdication of constitutional duty  it will manufacture a constitutional crisis  this should be the lede senate inaction could split the court 44 for the 20152016 term and the 20162017 term sitting on this nomination means it ll be   october of 2018   before the court opens a term with a full bench 
0,minor point but is nt this incorrect  gt  scalia is the first supreme court justice to die midterm since robert jackson in 1954 rehnquist died on the bench in 2005 
0,reps are inna pickle  they either scorch earth obama s pick and bet they get the wh next year  or hedge and comprimise on a moderate obama may slip a more moderate person in if they hedge their bets  but where it s going either  next dem inserts way more liberal that obamas pick or  r  win the wh and can put a conservative judge in  but that is in turn  betting on trump s continued koolaid wallsmashing rise to the presidency  so i got ta ask em do you feel lucky 
0,if the late justice had died on january 15th of next year  ok  they might have a point at that point it s a week until inauguration  nothing s going to get done in that time  but it would be classy to consult with his successor to get the process started a week sooner  but cmon guysinauguration is 11 12 months away insisting on it now is just plain childish 
0,appoint and nominate do nt mean the same thing 
0,regardless of your liberalconservative views  one of the main reasons supreme court justices have lifetime appointments is so that they may adjudicate  free from political influence this whole debate that is currently raging was never supposed to have occurred in the first place as the nominee is supposed to be someone who is the most qualified for the job in both the eyes of the president and the senate conservative or liberal  it was nt supposed to matter 
0,suppose that the gop wins the presidency but the democrats recapture the senate does anyone really think that if the democrats vote down every nominee for 4 years that the republicans will just say   well  that s just the senate doing their constitutional duty to advise and consent boy this is hard  i hope we can find a reasonable agreement on a suitable replacement   hell no  they would rage out  part of why our political system mostly works in this country is that for over 200 years even bitter rivals have been able to act in a manner which reflects respect for civic duty when that broke down once before  more than 600000 people died to resolve the dispute  if the senate does nt consider nominees to the supreme court in good faith  they risk the entire political system crashing down civil wars have been fought over less than this 
0,whether or not you are a fan of president obama  it is his responsibility to present a nominee to fill the vacancy a full year without even a name provided would be gross negligence on his part  imho there are good  qualified candidates for the position and there are issues that need to be adjudicated without danger of a 44 nondecision

0,actually  we had elections in 2010  2012 and 2014  they resulted in the currently republican held senate  who has to confirm anyone obama might nominate 
0,we also had elections for congress and guess who won those  this is the kind of shit that happens when people only vote for president 
0,the president does not appoint justices he nominates  the senate approves or does nt approve

0,whether im in one of my libertarian moods or proconsumer liberal moods  im proud to always disagree with paul krugman 
0,i think that krugman simply fails to see what s happening  that sleepy america is gradually waking up to the fact that its system of government is badly broken and has to change krugman is a very smart economist  but he s looking at things through the prism of  business as usual  bernie s underlying premise is that  business as usual  has failed government needs to change  and he is leading the call for change it is about  the will of the people 
0,sanders clearly has  happy dreams   why else would he pay his interns less than the  15hour minimum wage he wants to force on the country 
0,to be fair  krugman s a staunch neoliberal so of course he s going to speak out against bernie s economic plans
0,to be fair  krugman is sort of a dumb guy

0,interesting  mine seems to be subsiding 
0,looooooooool  i love this  literally two posts above this one is a cnn link that says   in south carolina  big leads on both sides  so now is clinton really having a panic attack on sc or is the media lying to us  you decide 
0,there s no  panic attack  she s winning  easily 
0,what are you doing  bill  
0,i support sanders and it s a valid comparison they are both grassroots movements driven by frustration with the party establishment which are trying to steer the party to a less watered down version of what it claims to support they both have a more raw presentation which ignores the unspoken rules of what is okay to talk about they obviously have differences but from the high level  they are similar 
0,in fairness  before the tea party was coopted by fox news and freedomworks  it actually did have a legitimate grassroots origin which was born of   some   of the similar frustrations that sander s supporters are expressing now in this way the origins are not entirely dissimilar  what   i   think is amusing is that bill clinton is trying to smear sanders by comparing his supporters to a  successful  movement much as people may hate to admit it  the tea party completely changed the political landscape  and not just in dc  so i think the message is clear  folks former president bill clinton is telling sanders supporters that they too can change the entire political landscape   billisaberniebro
0,i do nt think that denigrating sanders supporters will prove to be a winning move for the clintons if hillary s supporters had half the passion as they do her campaign probably would nt be so nervous  in reality  i see huge differences between the sanders movement and the tea party the tea party was manufactured by fox news and freedomworks to serve the establishment s purpose whereas the sanders movement is a true grassroots movement against politics as usual night and day difference 
0,gt  he added that the democratic party is experiencing a pull to the left similar to the extreme right pull exerted on the republican party by the tea party  the irony is that the dnc pulled hard to the right beginning with his second term if anything  i see this is a selfcorrection  in fairness  he never said that sanders supporters are like the tea party  but he did make allusions to that effect  and  before i am blasted  i m a sanders supporter 
0,i know its intended to be a jab  but the tea party has been very effective at getting their vocal minority into a number of local and state positions 
0,more and more  i wonder if bill is not looking forward to living in the white house again  especially if he does nt get to have the oval office  he s been doing his  open mouth  insert foot  routine for a few days now 
0,they say things like this because they are desperate to hold power attack  attack  attack desperate that is the clinton way it s disturbing that anyone would support this family people that desperate for power should never be allowed to have it i ve asked people to explain why they support hillary the answer  because republicans that s it bernie is simply a superior candidate in the face of that truth  you attack and hope something sticks may the entire clinton family fade to a footnote 
0,thanks for lumping me in with the sarah palinmichelle bachmannted cruz sycophants bill 
0,also had interesting words to say about obama in 2008  gt   a few years ago  this guy would have been carrying our bags 
0,i m surprised people are arguing with this  i would ve thought the similarities to the tea party were obvious if anything  bernie is turning out to be more successful than the tea partiers were  he is challenging the party establishment  claiming that they are not representing the interests of a big portion of their constituents  and calling for change their tactics are pretty much the same  only the issues are different 
0,solid move  if your intention is to fuck up at everything 
0,he s not wrong the tea party movement was pretty successful and put people in office 
0,bill clinton started us out on the proverbial road to ruin with his thirdway  republicanlite shit policies  and now his wife wants to finish the job no thanks 
0,fair comparison  bernie supporters are very grass roots  however  i would say they are the antitea party 
0,now now bill  i have nt seen a sanders supporter with  a factually contradictory sign that betrays their lack of understanding of the issues   https  wwwgooglecomsearch  q  keepgovernmentoutofmymedicareamp  biw  1390amp  bih  770amp  source  lnmsamp  tbm  ischamp  sa  xamp  sqi  2amp  ved  0ahukewixiyr12_zkahvesimkhbilacgq_auibigb 
0,he s not wrong just because his last name is clinton  guys  he s 100  right this is absolutely the left s tea party moment 
0,the clintons are berning down their own campaign 
0,the ironic thing is that the democratic party could benefit from having a radical  do this or be primaried  movement willing to push the party to the left and allow the moderates to say  i would pact with you but those crazy people would eat my liver   in parlamentary systems the comunistgreenleftlibertarian parties are the ones doing pushing so the democratic socialist and liberal parties remain honest  it is heartbreaking that the husband of a  progressive  sees the progresive wing of his own party as the enemy  since hillary and bernie  agree  on so many things it must be so hard for her 
0,good at least _someone_ seems to see what s happening  shape up or be fractured  dnc 
0,in a way  bernie supporters are like the tea party citizens who are fed up with status quo party politics organizing to elect individuals that will change their party the difference is ideology 
0,he s not wrong half the people on this subreddit list trump as their second choice for president 
0,this is just crazy  bernie fans are ideological purists  fighting against a democrat in name only  dino   and trying to purge the establishment from dc  the tea party are ideological purists  fighting against a republican in name only  rino   and trying to purge the establishment from dc  big difference 
0,let me say that i certainly hope so  the tea party has completely taken over control of the gop to such an extent that the party establishment can no longer dictate to them with absolute authority  let s also take a moment to remind everyone that the tea party during it s inception was made and built by ron paul and his supporters it was nt until later that the movement was hijacked by a torrent of koch money and became simply an outcry of  boo obama   seeing as bernie s army puts corrupting money at spot  1 as far as problems go that s one we likely wo nt see 
0,whatever anyone thinks of the tea party  it s a simple fact that they ve done a decent job wresting control of their party back from the entrenched corporate interests that were attempting to dominate it or at least they were  and even now there s a weird combination of uneasy alliance vs power struggle going on  if we can do the same on the left  i ll be very happy 
0,i mean  we are both interested in politics i guess 
0,he is correct  in that the fact the tea party was a republican cashroots campaign that took over and radicalized republicans and got them participating in government if this is somehow a bad thing for democrats to emulate then i missed the memo stating the government is a representation of corporate interests and not a representation of the peoples interests  edited for clarity 
0,damnit bill  i thought we were cool 
0,bill is gon na hand this election to bernie 
0,well then it would be wise for democrats to fall in line would nt it  the tea party cost several representatives their jobs and fractured the republican party beyond repair  of course the tea party is just a front for monied interests to cripple the federal government  but i think my point still kind of stands 
0,the clintons seems to think that it matter more that you get something done no matter what the consequences are than to be principled and not pass conservative legislation for the republicans 
0,i make a point to never take anything a serial rapist says seriously  nypd detectiveretired  
0,man  i used to like bill 
0,as a bernie supporter  there s some truth to that  the most rabid of us seem to not give a shit that they re using right wing attack fodder so long as it helps bernie all in the name of  fuck the system   the narrative is in fact being played by the system  it s disheartening really 
0,i compare clinton supporters to republicans like jeb 
0,theres no way thats going to turn voters off of hillary 
0,the tp was and still is a minority of the republican party progressives are damn near half of the democratic party the tp was and still is a group of know nothing bigots who were pissed an african american democrat was elected president their campaign was to take their country backfrom negros and to give every man  woman and child a gun progressives have real issues they stand behind that actually have a real impact on most americans  both financially and socially bill  if you treat us like the tp  we wo nt vote for you it gets worse though many others will be motivated to campaign actively against you you have made a grave mistake unfortunately  by the time your stuck in the 90 s campaign figures it out  it will be to late 
0,at least we do nt betray others 
0,they re literally doing the same shit as in 2008  like they thought obama must have been a fluke and it ll work this time obama was an approaching wave  and it s beginning to crest nothing will stop it  only slow it down  simply because time keeps on going forward and there s a whole generation or two that has more of it left on their side than the other generations do 
0,bill  why are you making me dislike you   why  i always liked bill clinton  thought he was a pretty good president how are comments like this supposed to make me feel 
0,nice try bill  maybe tomorrow s spitball claim will actually stick 
0,he is nt wrong bernie supporters often accuse her of not being a  true progressive   similar to how tea partiers primaried conservatives who they thought were rinos despite agreeing with them on most issues 
0,as far as i can tell they have nt been coopted by billionaires intent on fucking up america just yet 
0,bernie sanders supporters are increasingly becoming a liberal tea party a section of the democratic party unrelenting in its  extreme  principles  complete distrust of the current establishment  and a set of policy proposals which are outside the main stream of the democratic party  e  while bill clinton is trying to smear bernie sanders supporters i m not i just think he happens to be right whether that means sanders  unelectable  or if this is even a concern for his campaign remains to be seen 
0,it s the  third way  centrist obstructionists that impede progress they are those chanting  no we ca nt 
0,bernie sanders is no tea party insurrection 
0,we can both play this game  i suppose  bill clinton is a rapist  see  hurling shit at a wall until it sticks is fun 
0,this is what happens when you ca nt provide one simple  nonfluffy reason as to why you re running for president 
0,bill  you are making a fool of yourself 
0,as if i needed another reason to vote for anyone but hrc in the event bernie does nt win 
0,i did nt think it was possible  but i have less respect for bill with every detrimental comment he spews about bernie and his supporters he should realize he s going to need us if hillary somehow wins the nomination
0,go back to getting your dick sucked  bill
0,okay  bill clinton has jumped the fucking shark 
0,anybody who says  well i guess bills kind of right  the two movements are kind of similar in some respects  is missing the point  while bill is correct hes only trying to make a loaded point in an attempt to discredit the sanders campaign it s transparent rhetoric meant to create a negative association this is alarming because not only is it yet another black mark on clintons unethical campaign and persona  its just stupid politics it alienates voters and further divides a party that wants to win the general incompetence of this level does nt deserve to be rewarded in the internet age 
0,bill is shocked that progressives are trying to pull the democratic party back to the left after him and his third way democrats pulled it to the right  shocker 
0,bill  do yourself a favor  go ask your current intern for teabag 
0,ok  that s it  fuck this guy 
0,you did nt say it in your dream  carson you said it out loud on front of everyone you are awake this is the real life you were nt supposed to say it out loud 
0,this is such an obvious thing it almost has to go without saying if there was a republican president  the debate would ve gone like this   should president republican nominate a replacement justice   and then every candidate would ve said   of course  that s what the constitution says  if the democrats try to block the nomination they re clearly trying to impede democracy there s historical precedent of nominating justices  there s so much hypocrisy in modern politics it s disgusting at least admit that you only want obama to wait because he s not going to nominate a judge you agree with 
0,gt  carson said the supreme court has become a  political tool   adding that it might be time to look at term limits for the justices   when we enacted that program  the average age of death was 47 and now it  s 80 you know  things have changed  so we need to change with them   carson said  i m confused is ben carson making a well reasoned argument 
0,carson surprised me for once 
0,this precedent the gop speaks of  does not exist   http  wwwscotusblogcom201602supremecourtvacanciesinpresidentialelectionyears  
0,carson said something not crazy 
0,am i wrong or did they choose that photo as an homage to the kermit meme 
0,carson woke up just long enough to make a valid point but by the time the last word left his lips his eyes had returned to their familiar glazed appearance 
0,gt  then again  recognize that the two picks that the president has selected are ideologues  so there  s really no reason to believe that his next pick wouldn  t be an ideologue also  a  we d have to go back to anthony kennedy probably to find a supreme court nominee who was nt an ideologue  and even then  most were surprised kennedy s voting record turned out to be moderate  b  the president has nt picked yet therefore no one knows if this pick  who does not yet exist  is an ideologue  or not no one knows who it is  no one has had a chance to examine the person s record no one has had a chance to interview the person and to find out their thoughts and positions  basically  obama could pick someone so conservative that they make scalia seem like a bleedingheart liberal  and the republicans would still be opposed no on substance  but because its obama s pick they are opposed to everything obama does because obama did it they disagree with much of what obama does for substantive reasons  of course  but with all of it for the childish reason of trying to prevent obama from doing anything at all  even when they agree with him 
0,i respect him for being honest about this are we really expecting politicians to lie to us  that s terrible 
0,the voice of reason comes from the weirdest places sometimes 
0,thank you for confirming our suspicions  ben  mighty neighborly of ya 
0,god damnit  mitch mcconnel is so mcawful that he s making me agree with ben carson  fuck off  you obstinate turtle 
0, carson said the supreme court has become a  political tool   adding that it might be time to look at term limits for the justices  holy fuck  ben carson just said something i actually  agree  with feels weird  man 
0,the egyptians would nt wait for the pharaoh to die to fill the pyramids with grain 
0,ben carson does nt want to be president  he wants to make a good show of things so he can charge tons of money in speaking fees that s called  pulling a palin  
0,i just want to say that this thumbnail is perfect 
0,does anyone else find it ironic that scalia would not agree with limiting terms of justices as carson throws out at the end 
0,i think most recognize he is allowed to nominate but the senate is still allowed to deny it
0,aw shit it must be the end times  because i agree with everything ben carson said in that article
0,jesus christ i ca nt think of a better thumbnail than that for this post he s like  i m just saying you know 
0,thank you  captain obvious 
0,i see they forgot to keep drugging his coffee 
0,of course is this really not common knowledge  do people really not realize it s an attempt to let a republican president nominate someone 
0, sips coffee  but thats none of my business 
0,he s entirely right  the only reason that republicans are complaining about obama being able to appoint a nominee for justice is because they fear that he ll pick someone that they do nt like  the republicans all agree that obama is  undermining the constitution   those are words taken straight from marco rubio s mouth   but when he has a  constitutional duty  to perform  they scream  he s gon na pick someone we do nt like  he should nt obey the law   hippocracy at its best 
0,of course not it s all posturing
0,lucid dreaming ftw 
0,scalia relied on textualism and originalism on the bench republicans loved him then  ben carson  who is seeking the republican nomination  says  things change  we should change with them  wut happen 2 originalism ben 
0,smartest thing he s ever said 
0,just saying
0,that has got to be the first god damn thing he s said that sounds sane the whole bit was very rational 
0,even a broken clock is right twice a day 
0,well duh seriously  they just need to drop the act  we re going to block anyone obama picks because he s a democrat and we re republicans and we do nt want them gaining any more power it s politics  just say it we already know it  seriously  i would respect them more if they would quit pretending it has something to do with the american people choosing 
0,why is he still running  he obviously does nt care about his image in the party anymore 
0,no one actually cares  no republican  be they voter or legislator  gives a shit about whether there s precedent for stalling like this  and most of them are nt even pretending to does it prevent obama from achieving his agenda  then they re for it it s that simple 
0,until the last 25 years or so  the increase in life expectancy was due to the decrease in infant mortality and childhood diseases if you survived until adulthood  your chance of a full life was pretty good 
0,well  he s right 
0,reason among the republicans   or does it just look reasonable out of context 
0,sleepy ben said what everyone already knew  risky bet ben  let s see how it plays out 
0,what happened to carson  
0, come on  ben  memorize your lines  and say only your lines   marco rubotio
0,wow the pubs sure are getting pretty good at blurting out the things that everybody already knows but denies 
0,no shit the democrats know this the gop knows this obama knows this my 8 year old even knows this everyone knows this this wo nt stop the gop from being a bunch of obstructionist hypocrites  however 
0,the real question is  how did the reporter manage to get a full quote  every single reporter who has interviewed carson dozed off half way into the first sentence 
0,not only did he call the gop a bunch of hypocrites  but he also put forth an argument against the whole conservative ideology at the end lol 
0,wait did fucken ben carson have a moment of lucidity and logic  something grounded in reality and an analysis of the situation argued from logos instead of ethos  holy fucken shit 
0,and democrats would stonewall the fuck out of them  what else is new 
0,i m pretty sure carson does nt know what the word ideologue means 
0,it s not just obama  but it s kind of funny how our politicians on both sides use the constitution when it helps them and disregard it when it is convenient for them 
0,first time for everything 
0,is he going to enforce the laws on the books and deport all those illegals  did nt think so 
0,it s been a talking point so testing companies can make money it s also an aspect of dog whistle politics and implicitly and explicitly divisive  it encourages an  us vs them  towards people who are struggling 
0,just a thought  is nt it possible that welfare recipients who otherwise would have used drugs decided not to because their benefits depended on it  i m not saying drug testing welfare recipients is a good thing  but i m also skeptical that this proves welfare recipients use drugs at a significantly lower rate than the national average 
0,i do nt know why they d panic in sc  unless internal polling shows a sure sanders win in nv and they re worried about sanders getting a bump from a nv win 
0,maybe she can get some xanax from her pharma buddies

0,interesting  mine seems to be subsiding 
0,looooooooool  i love this  literally two posts above this one is a cnn link that says   in south carolina  big leads on both sides  so now is clinton really having a panic attack on sc or is the media lying to us  you decide 
0,there s no  panic attack  she s winning  easily 
0,gt  in his tennessee stump speeches  clinton credited obama for doing  a better job than he has gotten credit for   but he also criticized him for failing to end washington gridlock  gt   a lot of people say you don  t understand  it  s rigged now   clinton said  yeah  it  s rigged now because you don  t have a president that  s a changemaker 
0,so  as a black mixed race person  this is super offensive  race is a social construct bubba get a clue

0,is he going to enforce the laws on the books and deport all those illegals  did nt think so 
0,tl  dw  voter turn out numbers this year were  lower  this year in new hampshire than compared to 2008 because 2008 had a much bigger getoutthevote machine with 8 democratic candidates while 2016 only has 2 candidates in absolute terms  bernie sanders shattered the record with 150k votes  with the previous record holder being hillary with 112k votes conclusion  bernie is turning out voters 
0,bernies revolution has to do with congress and the senate right  thats the main premise of his ability to get his policies enacted  to have a revolution  although im sure the republicans will say its to start a communist revolutionary takeover by playing ads with the soviet national anthem im actually looking forward to what kinds of bullshit they will try and throw at him 
0,boy  that guy sure takes his sweet fucking time getting to the point  does nt he  that s why i do nt listen to talk radio regardless of political leaning 
0,really  because i see news stories about bernie sanders all the time 
0,man  those the media guys sure are jerks why  they even give me a feeling like i m a victim sometimes 
0,i wish people would stop calling it a political revolution it only brings to mind maoist china when you say it like that 
0,and hillary clinton still commands an equal if not greater following  but you wo nt hear that on reddit

0,the media wo nt tell me  wow huffington post  washington post  and most the internet are so far up sander s ass hole that they are telling me he shits gold and that they see it for themselves waaaaaaay up there  all i hear about is the bern regardless of if he s great or not  do nt feed me that shit about the media not talking about him  bull fucking shit 
0, the media is cheating me   every politician ever if you believe it  you re an idiot especially in this case the media actually has massive financial incentive to have a close race between sanders and clinton political ads bring tons of money to television stations  radio stations  etc the closer the race  the more money the candidates are going to spend trying to eek out the victory

0,voting is nt a revolution call me when there s barricades on the streets  homeslice 
0,tldw  bernie got more votes than any candidate in the new hampshire primary has ever gotten before 
0,i think the real revolution is towards someone more moderate i ve seen inklings of trump s realization of this i think the candidates have made the mistake of running to the extremes kasich could grab into this trend if he had more charisma  the person in the middle in november will win

0,fuck off with this circlejerk bullshit  you guys are ruining reddit 
0,we do nt need em bern it down 
0,hahahahahahahahahaha
0,the  revolution  is real it s a rejection of globalist neoconservatism  being  policeman of the world   supporting us global hegemony at all costs i have bad news for bernie supporters  the revolution also rejects the agenda of the  globalist left  as well  through overwhelming public support for shutting down illegal immigration and curtailing legal immigration as well for years and years  the globalist left s political strategy has been to import thirdworld voters who support their agenda and do everything in their power to make sure they vote  reject voterid laws  bus people to polls  advocate compulsory voting  and even complain about how nebulous  oppression  causes disenfranchisement rather than pure apathy and lack of agency 
0,so much innuendo so little facts why so coy  if you got something tell us this article is almost meta it s an article about how the writer might go get the sources and facts needed to write an actual article 
0,what a ridiculous piece of agitprop how hard have republicans tried over the years to get one of these laughable scandals to stick  i d at least like to see some originality this time around remember when she was accused of murdering vince foster  then when the obvious lack of evidence became undeniable it simply became another part of the elaborate conspiracy what is more believable  that no plausible reason for indictment exists or hilary is some kind of cartoonish supervillain who acts with impunity and controls the free world from the shadows  if you believe the latter  please also explain why she would want to run for president since she obviously has everything figured out already 
0,man the ny post really has it in for hillary 
0,it s the post never trust the post i do nt even like hillary clinton  but if you guys are at the point where the new york post  a murdoch owned tabloid  is considered a legitimate news source on clinton then there is something seriously wrong with you guys they ve been publishing unsubstantiated hit pieces against her for over 20 years  they are nt exactly unbiased 
0,this rpolitics browbeating is becoming really grating 
0,republicans were saying this about whitewater and cattle futures and travelgate over 20 years ago 
0,berine supporter here just came in to say   ny post  lol 
0,lolor it might just mean that  despite a concerted effort for 30 years to connect her from everything from murder to drug running  these are nt real issues 
0,it  might  also be reasonable to conclude that her not having been indicted is a sign she has nt broken any laws  you know  if you re posting fox news and ny post articles in support of your cause  it might be time to evaluate your course 
0,uhh i have a great idea  let s get ken starr back and give him unlimited power and tons of money to investigate endlessly and if he takes long enough maybe she will get caught having sex with an intern and all the little trolls can say  see i told you so  we always knew she did something  we just had to wait long enough for her to actually do it  gotcha  she s not my first choice for president but if she s so damn good at getting away with all the stuff she s been accused of for 30 years  then maybe she d make a tough and crafty president  in her absence i would nominate the following paragons of virtue  bob livingston  tom delay denny hastert scooter libby newt gingrich irancontra etcetc  yo investigate this  shit happens on both sides of the aisle but since the day bill clinton announced his first run for president  the republicans have redefined the term  witch hunt  if they were half as obsessive about fixing things  we d all be living in the  real  america we all deserve
0,hillary clinton has never broken a law is that the kind of person you want for president 
0,its weird to me that this is pretty high on rall but the comments unanimously think its bullshit 
0,oh my god the republicans used to be the worst when it came to slandering other candidates  but the democrats have now taken the cake 
0,this article is a pure piece of innuendo in which the only source cited by the author are previous writings by the author  and yet hillary haters will inglorious that to spin a tale  just as the author does
0,imagine how much praise rpolitics would be raining upon this woman if bernie was nt running 
0,yawn there have been stories like this promoted by the right wing nut jobs for decades  not years  decades from arkancide to benghazi the republicans have been spouting bullshit lies about hillary forever lies  lies  lies

0,taxpayers spent millions of dollars investigating the clintons and turned up not a whit of truth of the right wing conspiracies 
0,while i of course like the title  we should probably disregard nypost articles 
0,i ca nt pinpoint if but something looks different about herhttp  imgurcomkqgo1jr
0,maybe the author of this article could show an example of a crime worthy of indictment  and why hillary was nt prosecuted for it  seems to me there s ample political will to prosecute the clinton s for any wrongdoing from the right  so if there s sufficient evidence out there  why is nt it being acted upon  just reporting that other people say there s wrongdoing worthy of prosecution is nt  evidence  of anything other than what that person claimed if ken starr has evidence that a crime was committed twenty years ago  what s he been waiting for 
0,you know  if you re posting fox news and generating discussion and opinions based on faulty information

0,like that republican nixon not getting indicted 
0,you know  if you re posting fox news and ny post really has it in for hillary 
0,heh i just posted a similar sentiment in another thread before i even read this yes  its opinion but it makes me feel good that im not alone in seeing how hillary is the symbol for so many aspects of our country that are broken its also nice to see that more and more people are beginning to wake up to these concepts hillary is hardpressed to convince voters that she ll fix the very systemic problems that created her

0,if she did nt know her husband had a loose cannon by now  there s just no excuse 
0,the  mixed race  comment is odd but not completely out of line  notwithstanding the criticism of the random  democratic blogger  they quoted more damaging is probably his claim that hillary clinton is a  changemaker  who can get things done where president obama could not  for two primary reasons  1 anything that she can accomplish with an overwhelmingly republican congress will come at the expense of the voters she is courting in the democratic primary  2 it illustrates an undeserved smugness as well as disdain for president obama s accomplishments it also demonstrates that her attack on senator sanders for being insufficiently supportive of the president is disingenuous political theater 
0,gt  in response  aaron camp  a democratic blogger  wrote   for  mr clinton  to claim that we are all mixed race people    is dismissive of the serious problem of racism and racial inequality in this country  and  as a matter of fact  racist  valid point but i could nt care less what a  blogger  has to say

0,what s sad is that the damage the lead poisoning causes is nt really treatable i ve heard that they can kind of remove the lead from a person s body  but the brain damage is irreversible forgot to mention that the damage is done mostly to children  because it stops their brain from developing properly  i first heard about it on npr  it was  this   http  wwwnprorg20160122463929541leadpoisoningdatesbacktoromantimes  interview  this   http  wwwnprorg20151018449747061lessonsfromafighttofixflintswatersupply  one is also pretty good 
0,the comments from the parent about the decline in their child s ability to focus and do their schoolwork was heartbreaking  the fact is that the local and state government decided to turn their heads how much did the federal government know  and how long ago  all these government officials turning their heads and acting like this whole situation is frightening to say the least why did they do it  special interests  lobbyists  was it because the majority of the community was poor and they figured nobody would care  was it racially motivated  all of the above  one has to wonder if this is happening elsewhere in the us these political officials do nt give a rat s ass about communities that do nt contribute to their campaigns  it s time for a change 
0,episode 7 of cosmos  2014  exposes the detrimental effects of lead on humans especially children house are condemn for having lead paint and here we have whole city s water system contaminated by lead and the officials stick their heads in the sand someone needs to be charged with a crime 
0,not to mention flint is in a state surrounded by fresh water 
0,that s what happens when you do nt invest in infrastructure because you think government projects are a waste of money people used to understand that if you do nt fund public works nothing works for the public 
0,is nt it weird what happens when nobody votes in elections  stuff just kinda  falls apart  just sayin
0,i attended this rally today bernie was dead on in his statements regarding flint  and america s larger problems with infrastructure and crumbling  decrepit inner cities i especially liked his proposal to employ jobless americans to repair america s failing public works 
0,why is it when hillary visits flint it s pandering but it s ok when bernie goes

0,that story he told today at the rally was heartbreaking had me holding back tears for my fellow michiganders 
0, your town is a shithole   crowd cheers 
0,too bad sanders is nt part of the legislative branch  then he just might be in a position to do something about it 
0,it is  after all  the present year 
0,im a sanders supporter and the 1st thing i thought of was the communities response when hillary did this  my question is with all his talk wtf is bernie going to do right now not when he wins but right now  if he just talks about it honestly hes no better than hillary
0,i like how when sanders does something it s good and totally not for political reasons however  when clinton does something it s a political side show and she is only doing it to get votes 
0,i mean cmon ppl its 2016
0,well sanders  the predominant areas are all in cities controlled by one party and controlled by that same party for decades it is a real shame but it never came to light until they could try and pin it on a republican during an election cycle
0,and they knew  all the way up to the federal epa for months without telling people they were drinking poisoned water they took this time to argue over who s fault it was rather than to come up with a fix  this is nt a failure or one city or one state  it is a failure of government 
0,he s meeting with them now and he did nt know  has nt this been going on for a while 
0,got it hillary goes to flint  to see the people and condemms the situation vote grabbing just trying to get the checkoff for minorities and articles calling her out saying it was for other reasons sanders goes to flint  because he s a great man and condemms the situation  goodness out of his own heart and ttly not related to his political aspirations 
0,think how much  and of importance  will be  how much of flint  michigan s future has already been washed away with poisoned water a generation of young people whose potential has been capped by a lead ceiling they will struggle against for the rest of their lives are we not already engaged in a civil war  of which this is but one of many similar conflicts  this is not peace people at peace do not kill and maim each other with poison 
0,wow  bernie disagrees with poisoning people   just like me      feel the bern
0,the government has horribly failed their citizens what we need now  is bigger government to fix the problem 
0,i do nt like the  think about the children   line how about we re poisoning everyone in the region 
0,i am surprised that none of the billionaires in this country have thought to give back to an american city in need  the american people would love anyone who could do that public universities and private foundations could compete for the prestige of making flint great again 
0,gt  mr sanders said that he didn  t want to be  overly political  but that he had called for the resignation of gov rick snyder of michigan   if the local government can not protect those children  if the state government can not protect those children  then the federal government better   he said  oh really  well you just politicized it dipshit um is nt this a utility and a failure of local government  the federal government would do the exact same thing as the governor and delegate responsibility locally what party was running the city  nevermind i already know the answer  fuck you bernie you re so full of shit 
0,some politicians talk about getting rid of those darn regulations  one said it ll eliminate poverty if we do   i think i d like to see a few more  and maybe some funding for the people running things   unsafe lead levels in tap water not limited to flint   http  wwwnytimescom20160209usregulatorygapsleaveunsafeleadlevelsinwaternationwidehtml

0, it s current_year   feel le bern
0,i love how clinton does this and it s obviously pandering to blacks because you know  she s racist and the devil but sanders does it and it s a great thing  what a champion of the little people    viva la revolution

0,of course a fucking frog would say something of this nature  just look at how great their socialist economy is doing  s
0,gt  french economist
0,one problem that will need to be addressed before even mr sanders  economic prescriptions can work  our currency is overloaded  in a computer program  if the programmer tries to do too many things with one variable  the result is sure failure humans overload their currencies in the same way and to the same result  they try to make their currencies do too many things at the same time a medium of exchange  a medium of wealth storage  a means of demonstrating success  etc this can be fixed by using specific currencies for specific things  a saving currency  a trading currency  an investment currency  etc make tax policies specific to the uses of the various currencies and to their conversions from one type to another this would require secure electronic currencies  on a related note  what is a good way to really screw up a government  hoard their currency or otherwise take it out of circulation  the us and other governments are experiencing this now as multinational corporations stash currencies in outofreach banks governments are foolish to allow these people  aka  corporations   to undermine their currencies in this manner

0,as someone who helps people sign up for the aca  50  of the callers i get ca nt afford the premiums even with a tax credit 20  can afford it with their tax credits i would say 10  have great prices and the rest are sent to medicaid or are eligible for exemptions obviously i know those numbers are nt extremely accurate but i m just giving my input based off the calls i get 
0,the aca is better than what we had before  but it s still far from a good system millions of people still have no access to health care because they ca nt afford the insurance premiums even people with decent insurance are going bankrupt because of deductibles  copays and expensive premiums the insurance industry does nt give a shit about our health it s time to get rid of the health insurance industry it should not exist it is just a parasite 
0,you know what is the current situation with healthcare in america   44 million people in this country do not have health insurance   33 million more are under insured   29 million adults fall into the medicaid coverage gap in which 89  are from the south 45  are white 41  are full time workers 26  are from texas  source   http  kfforghealthreformissuebriefthecoveragegapuninsuredpooradultsinstatesthatdonotexpandmedicaidanupdate  this is obamacare this is the aca  i think  and i believe many would agree  that hillary s  i m going to build on the aca  is really  i m going to make sure the health insurance industry remains a critical part of our healthcare system  whether or not medicare for all  single payer is  the  solution to our healthcare crisis  it is something worth pursuing throw out those who wish to keep the status quo 
0,universal health care means that everyone has health care universal coverage means everyone has to interact with an insurance company instead of a health care professional  if you re sick do you want to see a doctor or an actuary 
0,gt   insurers may soon be on a collision course with the republican majority in the new congress insurers  often aligned with republicans in the past  have built their business plans around the law and will strenuously resist republican efforts to dismantle it since mr obama signed the law  share prices for four of the major insurance companies  aetna  cigna  humana and unitedhealth  have more than doubled  while the standard amp  poor  s 500stock index has increased about 70 percent   http  wwwnytimescom20141118uspoliticshealthlawturnsobamaandinsurersintoallieshtml  hpamp  action  clickamp  pgtype  homepageamp  module  firstcolumnregionamp  region  topnewsamp  wtnav  topnewsamp  _r  1

0,or worse  only a percentage of a catastrophic cost  mine only pays 80   20  of omgfuckingbullshitwtfnofuckingwayfuckthis is still bullshit 
0,it a better wold  all insurance would cover is unforeseeable  catastrophic costs the fact that you need insurance to pay for things that you know you are going to need  checkups  defeats the whole point of insurance 
0,insurance is supposed to only cover catastrophic costs  it s not supposed to cover your  20 subscriptions that s not what insurance is  that s one reason why prices are so high  imagine if your car insurance company had to pay for oil changesfluidsinspectionsetc the price would rise dramitically
0,currently in nc the only health insurance provider  blue cross and blue shield  for about 1015 eastern counties is going to cease to do business there  so people with preexisting conditions who were finally able to get insurance due to the aca are now being told they will have no coverage within their own county so their only recourse is to travel hours away from their own towns and buy insurance  then whenever they get sick to drive those same hours to see a doctor at all the aca was great for a lot of reasons but it is still very lacking and we need to move forward on true universal health care  not universal health insurance 
0,insurance is expensive 
0,well we could take down the healthcare monopolies and then allow for capitalism to way down the cost allowing for healthcare providers to compete statewide would help these two would see a cost reduction and open up insurance to people who may not be able to afford it now i does nt have to be universal health care to work  it just ca nt have the monopolies they have now 
0,it only serves to help feeding the doctors who get artificial monopoly with government controlled supply if you want more coverage  allow more medical schools and students instead of subsidizing their monopoly i guess aipac has it under total control with this liberal narrative though
0,if medicaid expansion had been mandatory as in the original law  i think obamacare would be doing a much better job  however complying with the regulations made the private insurance market pretty brutal as far as sticker shock goes the new normal is a highdeductible plan  which incurs a lot more out of pocket lump payouts trying to meet that deductible if you  have health insurance  with a  3000 deductible  you can still easily go bankrupt when that bill hits  if not immediately then somewhere along the journey to your  10000 out of pocket maximum for the year  i have a middleclass job but the only way i could pay for the outofpocket expenses to treat my wife s cancer was borrowing from my 401k  most people are nt so lucky  situations like this are just so unfuckingnecessary that it s incredibly frustrating if america ca nt figure out affordable universal healthcare like every other wealthy country  then america is nt that freaking great 
0,yeah my deductible for going to the er is insanely high so high i could nt pay it anyway so no insurance is the real life reality
0,i had high hopes for the aca  but it has not done anything for me all the plans are either too expensive for me or have very high deductibles i m all for single payer everyone puts in and everyone gets covered seems simple to me

0,in the 1960s just before the government got involved in health care the cost of full coverage health insurance would be 20 dollars a month after inflation today 
0, sanderscare would take employer coverage away from tens of millions of satisfied customers  destroy the health insurance business  good 
0,the real question with sanders s plan is whether he s just pandering to his base to fire them up and get them more implicated in his campaign or whether he truly believes in this fantasy that he s trying to sell currently a working universal healthcare system needs much stronger price control mechanisms than the ones outlined so far in his plan  it just so happens that those price control mechanisms are also things that would be wildly unpopular to american voters  even though they d result in a fairer  more efficient overall system in the end is he just leading people on for their own good  this type of cynicism would run contrary to the image of integrity and honesty that he s trying to project so i m not completely sure what to make of this theory

0,disclaimer  i think obama should nominate someone  and the senate should hold confirmation hearings but this article does not accurately describe most republicans  statements on this issue  the vast majority of republican statements  although  notably  not the cruz one cited in the article  carefully phrase the issue as whether a nominee has been  nominated and confirmed  in the president s last year in office  although kennedy was confirmed in 1988  he was nominated by reagan at the end of 1987  so he does nt fall under this definition

0,kennedy having been nominated in 1987 to fill a vacancy created in 1987 a vacancy extended due to the rejection of robert bork for purely ideological reasons  got ta suspect a lot of rs remember that their sc nominees since bork almost always get hassled and delayed but the dem nominees got free rides this time around  why should they let a judge on the court that ll put a liberal majority on the court  it s not dems are gon na just let a president cruz appoint a conservative to replace ginsburg  this has all been building up for years since the dems stopped robert bork 
0,i might be going out on a limb here but maybe  just maaaaybe i am guessing that not many trump supporters are fond of obama so this will only be fuel for the donald to use in his next rally speech 
0,i think obama knows that there are a significant numbers of republicans that disagree with everything he says  and will thus continue to support trump  from the democrats  perspective  trump is the best gop candidate in the field because he is a wildcard and does nt follow the party line additionally  trump is not afraid to call out the gop s bullshit  even if trump does nt win the nomination  the longer he stays in  the more likely he is to damage the other candidates and the more likely he is to go 3rd party  obama plays chess the gop plays checkers 
0,this comment made by obama will only help trump because it elevated him above all the other opponents in south carolina obama basically recognized him as a front runner by making this statement

0,yep very serious you literally have to cry on camera to regain your failing support as president  obama just made trump the candidate probably will go up 5  in polls 10  nationally  thank you so much mr obama   yeah  i remember your campaign also mr obama  hope and change  marketing and selling but oh waityou also say that trump is just a great marketershow i dont understand mr obama  are you just a hypocrite  or a bit ignorant  or are you just being a political liar  i thank the sweet baby jesus obama just made trump the candidate because republicans dont like obama and many democrats also dont like obama blacks dont like obama  lol  now you bernie supporters just pray he keeps on kissing the bum of hillary 
0,i see what you did there barack  well played  well played 
0,has trump called him a stupid poopyhead yet

0,bernies revolution has to do with congress and the senate right  thats the main premise of his ability to get his policies enacted  to have a revolution  although im sure the republicans will say its to start a communist revolutionary takeover by playing ads with the soviet national anthem im actually looking forward to what kinds of bullshit they will try and throw at him 
0,boy  that guy sure takes his sweet fucking time getting to the point  does nt he  that s why i do nt listen to talk radio regardless of political leaning

0, the media is cheating me   every politician ever if you believe it  you re an idiot especially in this case the media actually has massive financial incentive to have a close race between sanders and clinton political ads bring tons of money to television stations  radio stations  etc the closer the race  the more money the candidates are going to spend trying to eek out the victory

0,hahahahahahahahahaha
0,the  revolution  is real it s a rejection of globalist neoconservatism  being  policeman of the world   supporting us global hegemony at all costs i have bad news for bernie supporters  the revolution also rejects the agenda of the  globalist left  as well  through overwhelming public support for shutting down illegal immigration and curtailing legal immigration as well for years and years  the globalist left s political strategy has been to import thirdworld voters who support their agenda and do everything in their power to make sure they vote  reject voterid laws  bus people to polls  advocate compulsory voting  and even complain about how nebulous  oppression  causes disenfranchisement rather than pure apathy and lack of agency 
0,but i thought kashkari was a goldmansachs shill s you can read his full remarks  here   https  wwwminneapolisfedorgnewsandeventspresidentsspeecheslessonsfromthecrisisendingtoobigtofail  gt  i believe we must begin this work now and give serious consideration to a range of options  including the following  breaking up large banks into smaller  less connected  less important entities  turning large banks into public utilities by forcing them to hold so much capital that they virtually can  t fail  with regulation akin to that of a nuclear power plant   taxing leverage throughout the financial system to reduce systemic risks wherever they lie 
0,pretty funny rpolitics is all over kashkari right now  but when he ran as a republican for governor of california back in 2014 he was labeled a shill and considered to be one of the worst men in california 
0,you know sanders campaign is having an effect on this country from top to bottom when headlines like this start popping up try and imagine seeing a headline like this back in 2006  it sounds ridiculous to even think about 
0,oh  so now we re listening to former goldman sachs employees and members of the fed  that s interesting 
0,wanting to place an arbitrary limit on the size of financial institutions is one of the strangest ideas to gain mainstream acceptance in the field of economics  the problem is not that banks are too big  it s that they re too leveraged  given the networking effects involved in finance  having 10 overleveraged small banks may not be any better than having one big overleveraged bank it may actually be easier to regulate and monitor the big one 
0,this is called damage control banks and the fed know reform is coming it s better to control your own fate than let others do it for you 
0,people forget that the federal reserve bank    is not    a government organization it is a privately owned institution it is  the  big bank 
0,he s wrong about  not seeing the next crisis   banks are still selling cdo s and we re due for another housing bubble it wo nt be as bad as the last one due to consumer confidence being low and inhibiting the unbridled optimism that fueled the last one rest assured that we can expect more of the same when the markets correct again
0,there is only one issue i have with what he said and perhaps some on who has a higher degree in economics than i do can explain why i m wrong  i have a minor in economics but does nt increased capital requirements mean banks have much less money to lend thus reducing the amount of money in existence  in economic terms anyway  and thus inflating the value of the dollar  since there is less of it in circulation  causing exports to weaken and imports to strengthen and if my understanding serves one of the problems of the recession was that bank credit simply dried up would nt this idea lead to a similar thing happening  also how small are we talking of making these banks  because economies of scale are still important to keep in mind when redistributing the banking system 
0,this is what they called nationalizing the banks usually we re very clear that we want the government to stay out of our personal finances 
0,he s just pandering nothing to see here
0,someone s feeling the bern
0,he ll either get bribed  assassinated  or threatened and  change  his mind 
0,i m a big sanders supporter  but you got ta admit this was just clinton being smooth as fuck he sweettalked a curator and offered to pick up some litter so he could bring a date into an empty museum that is god damned romantic and in no way political 
0,somehow i thought this would be about them working in place of strikers  the usual meaning of  cross the picket line  which i did think was an odd choice for s first date for anyone curious here is the full quote  from hillary  around which the article is based ethical or not  your choice  i m just providing the quote for those who do nt feel like clicking  gt  we both had wanted to see a mark rothko exhibit at the yale art gallery but  because of a labor dispute  some of the university s buildings  including the museum  were closed as bill and i walked by  he decided he could get us in if we offered to pick up the litter that had accumulated in the gallery s courtyard watching him talk our way in was the first time i saw his persuasiveness in action we had the entire museum to ourselves we wandered through the galleries talking about rothko and twentiethcentury art i admit to being surprised at his interest in and knowledge of subjects that seemed  at first  unusual for a viking from arkansas we ended up in the museum s courtyard  where i sat in the large lap of henry moore s sculpture drape seated woman while we talked until dark 
0,scabs 
0,the actual story here is pretty neat and only solidifies my affection for bill
0,jesus fucking christ they were nt going in as scab workers bill lied about cleaning up the place to get in so he could have an evening alone with his lady this is like a scene from a shitty romantic comedy  not some insightful view into the clinton s neocon leanings for fucks sake can we concentrate on actual fucking issues and not try to convince each other that america s most prominent family of civil servants is evil because their names are nt bernie and sanders 
0,this is a cool story they did nothing wrong it was a creative way to see some interesting art and  in bill s case  a way to impress the girl you like 
0,so bill clinton  as a college kid  conned his way into a museum and had it all to themselves  but this is now a story about how bill and hillary were scabs  and therefore can now be construed to be secretly antilabor  this fucking sub has lost all sense of perspective 
0,just came here to say bill looks glorious in that photo 
0,the two top posts on rpoliticsrising   on bill and hillary clinton  s first date in 1971  they crossed a picket line   rodham and clinton were offering themselves as replacement labor  blunting  if only temporarily  the effects of the strike on the university   king  amazing archival video appears to show the arrest of a young bernie sanders as a student activist in chicago
0,wow this is hilariously over the top a sweet anecdote about their first date is spun into a tale of antilabor scabs totally totally ridiculous  this hillarybashing is really getting embarrassing for the hillaryhaters 
0,really mods  come the fuck on now 
0,i note that bernie sanders has   never   gone on a date with bill clinton 
0,this article reflects the rightwing conspiracy that started 45 years ago to thwart the first woman president from taking office 
0,once again people realize that clicking on an article takes too much work to decide how biased the headline actually is
0,i loathe the clintons with the power of a thousand fiery suns  but i sometimes really appreciate ol  slick willie something else  that s for sure 
0,they grow up so fast 
0,i was told to vote for this woman by my union  iam  but i voted for obama and i will vote for bernie this post leaves a really bad taste in my mouth what hypocrite s they are 
0,good for them  it s pretty amazing that people are upset that the clintons picked up litter that the people who were being paid to do so refused to do  it s like many people always say if they feel the compensation for the job is nt fair  quit and find a job that s more in line with what they feel they should be getting  if they ca nt find a job that pays what they think they are worth  perhaps they are overestimating the value of the skills they bring to the table  i m aware this article was submitted as an attack piece  but the story makes bill clinton look awesome 
0,this is in striking contrast to sanders who got arrested on his college campus for protesting segregation practices 
0,how is that a date   
0,i was taught at a young age  under 10  about not crossing a picket line  but i lived in las vegas with some decent unions would the clinton s have been taught that lesson before they were  20 raised elsewhere in the 60 s 
0,well they do nt have to do that anymore now they ll just get 600k for reading off a speech 
0,scabs  who d imagine that 
0,i for one welcome the rise of the green tea party 
0,gt  yeah  i am telling people what they want to hear  people want jobs they want health care they want educational opportunities for their kids they want to deal with climate change they want the wealthiest people to pay their fair share of taxes yeah  that  s what i  m telling people and on every one of those issues  that is exactly what the american people want 
0,to be honest  if the bernie movement can bring as much change to the democratic party as the tea party brought to the gop  i will be happy hate their agenda  but they did drag the gop to the right and got their candidates elected 
0,i just love the fact that bernie is genuinely as frustrated as most people in america 
0,bill  you deregulated wall street and helped directly cause the great recession stfu and stop ruining your legacy 
0,oh boy  bill has lost his mind 
0,smart move by the bernster just respond as if bill clinton is a harmless rambling little man which is what he s becoming  at this point 
0,the tea party was bought openly this movement is nt bought openly  the money is against us openly  this is nt some fairy tale this is a referendum 
0,sometimes  a lot of times actually  i really genuinely think that bernie sanders is a truly honest man  a gifted man  one in a generation that s not to be taken lightly  i really do believe that in my heart of hearts listen to him absolutely shred bill clinton in no uncertain terms i like this man 
0,bill flubbed agin 
0,if he s as nuts as the tea party  why is hillary trying to pretend she shares the same platform 
0,close but no cigar bill
0,billy is so silly 
0,shots fired 
0,the difference between the tea party and feel the bern is that one of these groups can hold down a job 
0,i might be going out on a limb here but maybe  just maaaaybe i am guessing that not many trump supporters are fond of obama so this will only be fuel for the donald to use in his next rally speech 
0,i think obama knows that there are a significant numbers of republicans that disagree with everything he says  and will thus continue to support trump  from the democrats  perspective  trump is the best gop candidate in the field because he is a wildcard and does nt follow the party line additionally  trump is not afraid to call out the gop s bullshit  even if trump does nt win the nomination  the longer he stays in  the more likely he is to damage the other candidates and the more likely he is to go 3rd party  obama plays chess the gop plays checkers 
0,this comment made by obama will only help trump because it elevated him above all the other opponents in south carolina obama basically recognized him as a front runner by making this statement 
0,what a great endorsement for trump bush and now obama attacking him just cements him as antiestablishment

0,why do pundits still say trump is nt  serious   trump clearly stands to benefit by winning  both in terms of his net assets and in terms of political power and prestige 
0,yep very serious you literally have to cry on camera to regain your failing support as president  obama just made trump the candidate probably will go up 5  in polls 10  nationally  thank you so much mr obama   yeah  i remember your campaign also mr obama  hope and change  marketing and selling but oh waityou also say that trump is just a great marketershow i dont understand mr obama  are you just a hypocrite  or a bit ignorant  or are you just being a political liar  i thank the sweet baby jesus obama just made trump the candidate because republicans dont like obama and many democrats also dont like obama blacks dont like obama  lol  now you bernie supporters just pray he keeps on kissing the bum of hillary 
0,i see what you did there barack  well played  well played 
0,has trump called him a stupid poopyhead yet

0,gt  clinton leads sanders 50 percent to 40 percent heading into south carolina  whose democratic voting electorate is more racially diverse than either iowa or new hampshire  sanders holds a narrow 3point advantage over clinton  47 percent to 44 percent  among white voters  gt  while sanders has drawn a significant portion of his support from the youngest voting bloc  under the age of 30   just 25 percent of millennial black voters said they are supporting the vermont senator  compared with 64 percent who said they are backing clinton the reverse is true among white millennials  who support sanders 75 percent to 22 percent  gt  the poll was conducted online from feb 814  surveying 11417 registered voters nationwide the survey s overall margin of error is plus or minus 11 percentage points  this  graph   http  media2snbcnewscomjnewscms2016_071418976nbcsurveymonkey_weekly_election_tracking_poll_clinton_sanders_chartbuilder_adabea7e779bf0fd083d1d5d52364cffnbcnewsux28801000png  that i found  here   http  wwwnbcnewscompolitics2016electionclintonmaintainsnationalleadoversandersafternhlossn519076  shows the national poll  s and sanders slowly  but steadily climbing it also shows hillary s decline on a somewhat sharper slant  due to her own campaign implosions 
0,this is the 2nd national poll since nh that real clear politics refuses to put up 
0,ah yes  the daily  sanders is closing the gap  post 
0,i m glad he s closing the gap  but i would of thought the gap should be smaller given all the scandals surrounding clinton 
0,this is confirmed by  this graph   http  pollingreuterscom  polltr131  of a very informative running poll he s closing the gap among  blacks   http  pollingreuterscom  polltr131filterssc_race  2  very quickly too  a 2540  change over one month  one troubling conclusion from this particular data set for the sanders campaign is that he is gaining almost all of his support from previous nonvoters rather than from converted hillary supporters  particularly in the general population   the early registration deadlines in many states will prevent a large chunk of sanders  momentum from translating to actual votes  since his new supporters will be unable to register up to a month before the primary  for example  in texas  previously unregistered voters activated by his results in iowa  new hampshire and the considerable media attention he s received since then will not be able to vote for him the cumulative effect of this over all states might decide the entire primary election 
0,interesting piece of data from this poll  gt  while sanders has drawn a significant portion of his support from the youngest voting bloc  under the age of 30   just 25 percent of millennial black voters said they are supporting the vermont senator  compared with 64 percent who said they are backing clinton the reverse is true among white millennials  who support sanders 75 percent to 22 percent  this does nt really conform with the media narrative i wonder if there are other polls with similar results 
0,i m sure this has been posted before but has anyone seen this  a bunch of really conservative people have posted this on facebook today and i m worried it is going to hurt bernie in the polls if anyone reads this is there any truth to it  also i m voting for bernie regardless but i just wanted to hear what others had to say  http  wwwthegatewaypunditcom201602berniesandersabumwhodidntearnhisfirstpaycheckuntilage40  mtcid  cf

0,bernie sanders and the whitehouse  if you think the two do nt go together  you re not alone but you re also wrong  not that he would hold that against you because sanders  with apologies to the democrats  barack obama  is perhaps the nicest and most sincere man in politics and has been for 40 years  walk through congress with sanders before the gates open and you ll see him greet the security guards and ushers by name sit near the podium during fillibusters and you ll hear him call out to the lobbyists watch him afterward and you ll find him standing patiently by his locker  respectfully answering the lamest questions from reporters representing the smallest hometown newspapers  that was nt something you would see with hillary clinton  clinton would question your parentage  sanders will ask about your kids  then listen intently to the answer  when the supreme court held a memorial service for justice scalia  sanders flew to texas to see his family  then flew right back to take part in the service never mind that it was his only day off in a month  it s just respect   sanders said  yet a politician who shows respect to everyone does nt always see it in return  clearly sanders lacks the glitz and glamour  the flamboyance and the egotism to stand out in a tabloid world which is why he s thought of primarily as a nice guy and not a great politician  truth is  he s both  he s also crew cuts and blue collars he s middle america  right down to the  please  and  thank you  in his world  guns are for hunting  not for carrying into night clubs  no wonder the license plate on his pickup truck  what else would he drive   once read dbth  shorthand for do nt believe the hype  but you can believe the numbers  which make a strong case that sanders should be the president  in this case  a nice guy should finish first 
0,how many articles do we have to post about him closing the gap  how about posting an article when he closes it 
0,no he s not he s not even close conservative news outlets said the same thing about romney in 2012 just to give false hope even going as far as saying he won the election stop posting sensationalized headlines from misleading sources  edit  the people down voting me because i m stating facts are just as bad as the audience at the last republican debate who booed the moderators for stating facts 
0,gt  trump holds the support of one in three evangelical voters  33 percent  oh  i get it now  those are the hard core evangelicals who want to hasten judgement day trump is their protest vote against this earthly planet
0,i think you really ought to have highlighted this paragraph  gt  while sanders has drawn a significant portion of his support from the youngest voting bloc  under the age of 30     just 25 percent of millennial black voters   said they are supporting the vermont senator  compared with 64 percent who said they are backing clinton   the reverse is true among white millennials  who support sanders 75 percent to 22 percent   sanders supporters are young  white liberals all this talk of  closing the gap  is going to be embarrassing in just a few weeks very similar to the way evangelicals thought the rapture was coming 
0,black voters know that sanders  goals  as good as they might sound  are politically unrealistic hillary is the better choice because at least she will raise the minimum wage to  12  which is more than most people make 
0,i agree  blatantly hypocritical partybiased  leadership  is bad politics 
0,mcconnell did this because he s afraid of the gop base he knows exactly what limbaugh and beck would be saying if he had even feigned reasonableness the base would be up in arms if they thought for even a moment that the establishment would consider letting obama replace scalia he s stuck between a rock and a hard place 
0,it s bad politics  but unfortunately it s almost requisite in a destructive groupthink environment like the modern republican party if you do nt pretend to treat the talking points as gospel and reject compromise like a baptist rejects satan  you re rejected from the group when people make decisions based on fear of reprisal  they re being bullied those republicans who make blind pledges to block anything the president wants  they re being bullied by their own party  and they re caving to the pressure i do nt mean to say the victims of this bullying are nt in some ways complicit i m saying they re cowards

0,the  mixed race  comment is odd but not completely out of line  notwithstanding the criticism of the random  democratic blogger  they quoted more damaging is probably his claim that hillary clinton is a  changemaker  who can get things done where president obama could not  for two primary reasons  1 anything that she can accomplish with an overwhelmingly republican congress will come at the expense of the voters she is courting in the democratic primary  2 it illustrates an undeserved smugness as well as disdain for president obama s accomplishments it also demonstrates that her attack on senator sanders for being insufficiently supportive of the president is disingenuous political theater 
0,gt  in response  aaron camp  a democratic blogger  wrote   for  mr clinton  to claim that we are all mixed race people    is dismissive of the serious problem of racism and racial inequality in this country  and  as a matter of fact  racist  valid point but i could nt care less what a  blogger  has to say

0,does anyone know if conservatives  particularly republicans in the south  have some kind of more subtle agenda  s  beneath the veneer of  prolife  and  limited government   attempts to impede women s access to care in 2016 is so absurd that i often wonder if the motivations are deeper than just ignorancesexismracism  religion  and political ideology the ultimate consequences of interfering with women s health rights are so obviously ass backwards and to the detriment of society it makes my head explode  it would nt surprise me if many of these bastard politicians view such actions as a long term investment in their criminal justice systems and keeping their prisons filled  among other sinister motives  do these states  by chance  happen to reap any federal benefits from rampant populations growth  i know many red states get heavy federal subsidies it feels like there s more to it than concern for the  sanctity of life   perhaps i underestimate racism in the south 
0,funny  the only time i have personally heard the claim that planned parenthood was a conspiracysecret genocide of black people was from a professor that focused on black studies and who was herself black i also got to know a student who looked up to said professor as a mentor they both shared some of the most backwards  fuckedup  blmesque stances i have ever seen  this is not a conservative or liberal issue it s a misinformation issue people either make shit up to get what they want or they never bother finding out what s true or false before spouting shit to get what they want all dishonest sides will pull the same trick they want to break you down into groups so you re easier to control you can put any spin on any issue if you do nt care about the truth  here we see someone making an issue black and white while pretending to want to stop the issue from being black and white it is insane we have reached the point we have in politics everyone is contradicting themselves constantly the truth is the last thing they consider  i think the congresswoman made good points  and a gray stance would not bait as many clicks  but she is feeding the fire in her own way it is hypocritical and exhausting to see every day

0,gt  it s not just that the politician wants to act to curry the favor of the rich and powerful  more typically they identify with the interests of the rich and powerful so that they do nt even see themselves as compromising a principle  gt  when we actually see money being handed over to politicians from the wealthy  whether in the form of large speaking fees or a highpaying job  it is probably best to think of it as analogous to a valentine present no one loves their spouse or significant other because of a generous valentine gift  rather it is a symbol of ongoing affection 
0,self posts not allowed oh wait unless it s from a corporate entity it is
0,yes  they just want to throw money around for the fun of it have you not watch the wolf of wall street 
0,not the best analogy being in the cabinet does nt mean you just get to do whatever you want you d probably have to stay in your lane  how about   bernie sanders spent his 30year political career not just talking about income inequality and the necessity of government regulation on big banks  but acting on it does anyone believe goldman sachs would pay him  250000 to recount his experiences  
0,gt  suppose bernie sanders had spent four years in obama s cabinet and tried to break up the big banks does anyone believe goldman sachs would pay him  250000 to recount his experiences  except hillary did nt say that by all accounts given so far  it was more a rahrah speech than it was her telling goldman of her accounts of trying to break up the big banks so this entire statement is based on a false supposition 
0,i find it funny how almost every comment here is making fun of the stupidity of this post and article yet the article has 4000 points  87  liked  and is sitting at the top of reddit 
0,we ran out of everything else and now we re down to making up shit entirely eh 
0,the top comments in this thread are all people who only read the quote and not the entire article smh
0,wtf what a stupid argument clinton was sec state  not the sec treasury or head of any regulatory agency so she would nt be doing anything to threaten banks they likley had her speak bc she s a clinton  been around and former sec state  even if she was a regulator  it would nt surprise me if she would speak at a banking event  and any  breaking up of banks  would be bc congress came up with a law with regs requiring them to divest themselves of certain busiensses  ie reinstating glass  steagall provisions 
0,are you kidding  of course they would  why do you think it s the toughest most vicious prosecutorsregulators get hired by the banks  not only do poachers make the best gamekeepers  but it also takes them out of the equation if gs offered bernie a million to do some work for them it would make it much harder for him to come down on them later 
0,hillary is a status quo presidential candidate  if she gets the nomination and the job things will remain mostly as they are with little attempt to change them  the big banks know this 
0,just another way of saying what bernie said in the last debate   i m paraphrasing   i guess these banks just love to throw away money  right   it s obvious to anyone who will think about it  but plenty of people are invested in not thinking about it 
0,know thine enemy so yes they would he would most likely refuse it regardless if he was retired or not 
0,you mean  650k
0,i thing goldman sachs is double playing you all 250k is absolutely nothing to them but it is enough to appear to support hillary without really helping her this obviously actually hurts her and helps sanders  the one they really want in office because they can us him to suck the blood out of our economy and send us into depression  where sachs will profit massively 
0,exactly this  if i do not explicitly see it  it does nt exist  mantra is ridiculously short sighted i ve said the same thing before  probably on here   the politicians that do literally change their vote for cash  seem to be the ones that get caught the goal of the money is to bring these people into the same social strata as those with the money make them part of the club the more they hang out  the more washed over with those ideals they will be dishonesty is not a simple process 
0,ofcoursenothetalkstoslow 
0,sanders supporters  one problem is that some of us ca nt get on board with the evil wall street stuff it s very difficult legally to say exactly why and how you re going to prosecute bankers for what happened in 2008 it s very difficult to craft regulations to correct exactly the things we want without having either very bad unintended consequences  or loopholes that render them useless i see it as a problem we have as a country  and something we really need to think about and be smart about bernie actually kinda scares me with his us vs them stuff  if you have the time  take a look at  this video   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  qclmwlgcgg0  of a slightly boring economist who s studied the problem extensively to me this is kind of talk and approach we need if we really want to solve the problem sure  it s not a rousing as bernie s power to the people  stuff  but there you go let the republicans have their demagogues  someone needs to be the smart party 
0,i think it would be money well spent they can learn about his mindset and how to take evasive action for next time 
0,if he actually tried to break up the banks  getting a detailed debriefing of what worked  did nt work  and his thoughts on the matter   250k would be a bargain  think about it if you ran a company with billions in profit  and you spent millions on lobbying  paying think tanks  and other expensive tactics to prevent legislation and regulatory action against it spending  250k to find out from the other side what is actually working and not working would worth every penny 
0,does no one here remember anything that happened back when the clintons were still in arkansas  anyone that wants this person to be the leader of the   free world   has either had their head in the sand for the past 40 years  does nt pay attention to the history of this family  does nt care  or is probably under the age of 25 
0,that is so good  it should be in rshowerthoughts people are starting to wake up   
0,absofuckinglutely the correct question is do you think he d take it
0,if i were a wall street wolf  i would pay 250k for them to tell me how they tried to stop me  so i could learn more about how to defend my stake  and also because 250k is chump change

0,this article hits at my major reservation with clinton i do nt doubt her capability  i doubt her commitment to addressing of the concerns of my generation much of what young voters want is at odds with the clintonian  new democrats    third way  political triangulation 
0, in truth  our affluent  establishment democrats can no more be budged from their core dogmas  that education is the solution to all problems  that professionals deserve to lead  that the downfall of the working class is the inevitable price we pay for globalization  than creationists can be wooed away from the tenets of  intelligent design  
0,not bad for theguardian i like the last bit about the dogma of the left   education is the solution to all problems   not when preaching the wrong thing  edit  which was what the article was getting at  il admit i spedread
0,this  and another article  really describe to me the difference between clintonera thought and sanders thought clinton economics is to have unfettered capitalist coupled with biggovernment welfare in the form of transfer payments to those harmed by capitalism sanders favors a more fair form of capitalism that is restrained  designed to not allow people to become billionaires instead of transfer payments funded by taxes  he would rather see more opportunities with their cost baked into the pricing of goods and services  i prefer the sanders approach because it is tenable everyone hates high taxes to fund welfare payments it is better to put more people to work with an economy that is designed to do this rather than one designed to make a few people insanely rich 
0,if the democrats were against inequality  they would nt have given the shareholders of major financial corporations billions of dollars in free money over the past 8 years 
0,gt  that the downfall of the working class is the inevitable price we pay for globalization this is clinton s ethos so sorry  working class  but your suffering and futility is the price so that we can have our multinationals and cheap consumer shit but we all know  the elite are the real victims of globalization they get to see their fellow citizens suffer and die and it s the elite that has to deal with that burden 
0,so if republican establishment serves the 1  and democrat establishment serves the 10   1  inclusive   that leaves the 90  without any representation sounds like a cause for revolution to me it s just a republicrat money grab and some of you have been fooled to think it s different

0,as i posted on a different thread  i can not recall  or google  a supreme court candidate being nominated twice hence  if the senate is sincere about rejecting any and all nominees then whoever obama puts forward will be sacrificed it makes for an interesting decision in the white house  nominate the most appropriatedeserving and potentially lose them forever  or nominate a second tier candidate

0,the dnc is in a tight spot they ve put a lot of time  money  and effort into clinton  and are now increasingly willing to send good money after bad if they think that there s still a chance that they can pull clinton out of her nosedive to get her the nomination  they can similarly delude themselves into thinking that  by the general  the email thing will have blown over  especially if clinton herself has not been candid with the democratic leadership about what was on that system because  she  believes that they will have no choice but to back her if she can get the nomination  do nt operate under the assumption that just because the dnc establishment wants hillary as the nominee and hillary wants the support of the dnc that either trusts the other  honestly  one of the more damning things for clinton was the house gop taking a step back and just saying   you know what  we think the fbi s got this covered 
0,her supporters have admitted as such by saying there is no way the administration would prosecute if a crime is determined to have been committed and no charges are brought  that s the definition of protection

0,this trump guy is just a litigious snitch 
0,so it s a couple of links deep in this article  but if you go into the american gaming association s voter information papers that they actually distributed to gaming workers  they gave trump a yellow  green is considered progaming  red was antigaming  the man currently owns a las vegas hotel and casino and they gave him the same gaming rating as bernie sanders and the only reason they gave sanders a yellow is because  information not available  what an absolute sham the trump name literally is a part of the vegas skyline and this organization is trying to make trump out to be wishywashy on gaming 
0,i love arguing politics with coworkers
0,gt  the group s voter guide would probably pass muster in the precitizens united days  says larry noble  a lawyer for campaign legal center and former general counsel for the federal election commission  so the article is saying that  citizens united  has very little to do with this ability to essentially endorse candidates  before  citizens united   there was nothing wrong with a corporation saying  hillary clinton hates puppies   because the law drew a line at  hillary clinton hates puppies and you should nt vote for her  i m not really sure that makes a huge difference 
0,i ve found it s best to not discuss politics at work  mostly because i m pretty well informed and most people that want to talk politics are nt or worse  they re willfully ignorant 
0,that  casino voter guide   http  bigassetshuffingtonpostcomnvcasinovoterguidepdf  is pure garbage here are some highlights   hillary is designated  opensupportive  of gaming  apparently for paying some recent  lukewarm lip service to casino moguls this is despite her opposition to casinos when she was first lady of arkansas  which is mentioned first in the guide    ben carson is designated  opensupportive   and ted cruz is designated  mixed   but they have the same views  that it s up to individual states whether to allow gambling   cruz apparently loses points for saying the government should nt subsidize casino owners   bernie sanders is designated  mixed   citing  no information available  i suppose they could nt be bothered to make a fiveminute phone call to his campaign before printing up these brochures   donald trump is designated as  mixed   apparently because his atlantic city casinos went bust  along with the rest of ac s local economy   it s mentioned that trump currently operates a hotel on the vegas strip  but no bonus points appear to have been awarded for this 
0,keep just these recent decisions in mind where justice scalia was a part of the 54 majority that could have different outcomes if he is replaced by a democrat president   in a 54 majority limits in mccutcheon v fec  the court invalidated the aggregate contribution limits that were first put in place by the federal election campaign act of 1971   in atamp  t mobility v concepcion  the 54 majority ruled that corporations can effectively mandate arbitration agreements that preclude consumers from bringing class actions to combat fraud and enforce their rights without access to an impartial judge and jury  and without the resources to go it alone in arbitration  people typically abandon their claims and corporate wrongdoers are never held accountable many states enacted consumer protection laws to curtail the pernicious practice of forced arbitration  but in concepcion the supreme court held that such laws are preempted by an old federal statute from 1925 called the federal arbitration act  faa    the 54 majority in michigan v epa overturned epa regulations safeguarding communities from toxic pollution by power plants that causes up to 11000 premature deaths each year essentially  the court  s decision places a premium on businesses  bottom lines over public health and limits the epa  s ability to regulate hazardous air pollutants over the objections of corporate interests   in ledbetter v goodyear tire and rubber co  the 54 court majority made it virtually impossible to bring a claim of longrunning sex or race discrimination in pay under title vii of the 1964 civil rights act  a decision later reversed by a congressional statute a woman had been paid less than her male peers for 20 years and the court stated she had no right to bring a lawsuit for equal pay because she failed to file suit within 180 days of the first discrimination  even though she had no way of learning about the discrimination until years later   in davis v fec  a 54 majority overturned the  millionaire  s amendment   congress  s effort to level the playing field in the political process and reduce the influence of wealth on elections by increasing the contribution limits to candidates facing selffunded opponents   in florence v board of chosen freeholders  the 54 court majority ruled that local officials can stripsearch anyone accused of any crime  even if there is no reason to suspect contraband or concealed weapons  and can not be sued for invasion of privacy   the 54 majority in shelby county v holder overturned a key section of the 1965 voting rights act  making it much harder to protect against discrimination in voting not only did the majority dismissively reject tens of thousands of pages of congressional findings supporting the coverage formula contained in section 4 of the nearlyunanimous 2006 reauthorization of the vra  but the opinion was noted for failing to provide any legal or constitutional rationale for its holding nothing in the text of the constitution was cited to justify the court  s novel decision to strike down the cornerstone of american civil rights law   the 54 majority in leegin creative leather products inc v psks inc overruled a 96yearold rule that had made vertical price fixing per se illegal under federal antitrust law overturning the almost century of antitrust law  the court decided that manufacturers and retailers could sometimes engage in pricefixing in dissent  justice breyer cited studies estimating that this change in law would cost consumers  300 billion a year in increased prices on everyday items   a 53 majority  since justice sotomayor recused herself  in american express co v italian colors restaurant ruled that a smallbusiness owner could not bring an antitrust lawsuit challenging a large corporation  s alleged abuse of its monopoly power  even though  it was claimed  it was that very monopoly power that allowed the corporation to force an agreement to arbitrate and not litigate all complaints against it the court upheld the use of forced arbitration clauses even if it made enforcing federal laws like the sherman act practically impossible in dissent  justice kagan explained that the court  s decision allows   t  he monopolist    to use its monopoly power to insist on a contract effectively depriving its victims of all legal recourse   the 54 majority in burwell v hobby lobby stores  inc decided that forprofit corporations can claim religious rights and can exempt themselves from federal laws requiring them to provide contraceptive coverage to employees the majority also rewrote the religious freedom restoration act  with potentially dangerous consequences for lgbt and other americans   in parents involved in community schools v seattle school district  the 54 court majority prohibited school districts from attempting voluntarily to promote school desegregation through student reassignment plans   in walmart v dukes  approximately one million female walmart employees tried to file a classaction lawsuit over claims of sex bias the 54 decision by the court made it nearly impossible for a class of workers to use for widespread corporate misbehavior that comes in the form of unwritten policies essentially  every worker has to bring their own individual claim  making walmart and other large companies realistically judgment proof to these types of claim   in two 54 decisions  solid waste agency of northern cook county v us army corps of engineers and rapanos v united states  the court effectively took many waterways outside the protection of the clean water act  even though pollution from these waterways can dirty the drinking water of 117 million americans as a result of the court  s decision  1500 major pollution investigations have been halted  and epa actions against water polluters have fallen by 50    in national federation of independent business v sebelius which upheld the patient protection and affordable care act under the taxing power of congress  a 54 majority on the court overturned 70 years of precedent dealing with the commerce clause prior to this case  the court had held that congress has the authority to regulate activities that have a substantial effect on interstate commerce in the area of economic activities   substantial effect  can be found based on the cumulative impact of the activity across the country for example  the supreme court held that congress could use its commerce clause authority to prohibit individuals from cultivating and possessing small amounts of marijuana for personal medicinal use because marijuana is bought and sold in interstate commerce the relationship between health care coverage and the national economy is even stronger and more readily apparent the court had also said that congress could use its commerce power to forbid hotels and restaurants from discriminating based on race  even though their conduct was refusing to engage in commercial activity under an unbroken line of precedents stretching back 70 years  congress has the power to regulate activities that  taken cumulatively  have a substantial effect on interstate commerce people not purchasing health insurance unquestionably has this effect this ruling  if a liberal justice is replaced with someone like scalia  could overturn vast amounts of social programs like medicare and worker protections  on the other hand  occasionally a justice like justice kennedy has sided with the liberal justices to produce 54 decisions that would be in danger if a republican wins the white house and a liberal justice dies or retires while they are in office   in obergefell v hodges  a 54 court majority ruled that the constitution protects the right of samesex couples to marry   a 54 majority in texas department of housing and community affairs v the inclusive communities project upheld the longstanding interpretation of the federal fair housing act to prohibit practices with unjustified discriminatory impact   in massachusetts v epa  a 54 court majority upheld the authority of the epa to regulate greenhouse gases   a 54 majority upheld voterpassed nonpartisan redistricting reform in arizona state legislature v arizona independent redistricting commission   in williamsyulee v the florida bar  a 54 majority upheld a ban on state judicial candidates directly soliciting campaign funds   in boumediene v bush  a 54 majority ruled that prisoners detained in guantanamo can file habeas corpus petitions to challenge their detention   a 54 majority in alabama democratic conference v alabama invalidated a state redistricting scheme that used race to harm minority voters   a 54 majority ruled in favor of workers  rights in csx transportation v mcbride ruling railroads are liable for workers  injuries under federal statute if the railroad was partially responsible for the injury through its negligence

0,there was a fun little experiment done a couple years ago that showed that if you re a state legislator who supports voter id  you ve probably got racial biases in how you respond to your constituents  http  papersssrncomsol3paperscfm  abstract_id  2422596 basically  they sent out identical letters half signed with an anglo sounding name  half with a latino sounding name among legislators that supported voter id  the anglo sounding names were responded to over twice as often as the latino names there was little discrepancy with legislators that did not support voter id laws 
0,if you are an adult and do nt have an id  i m going to assume you re not a very productive member of society  democrats are just angry that voter id hinders their give people a bunch of free shit and bus them to polling stations strategy 
0,does anyone else notice that new mexico is listed as nevada on the map lol
0,i want to know why we do nt start off with  election ink   http  darkroombaltimoresuncomwpcontentuploads20120553afp_getty511140703jpg  nobody can get pissy with that 
0,that s the point 
0,wrote my college thesis on this issue via a case study of indiana vs massachusetts  2014   voter id laws particularly affected hundreds of thousands of hispanics  african americans  women  and elderly wouldbe voters voter id laws also resulted in less than 20 voter fraud convictions takeaway  voter id laws disenfranchise certain groups at an astronomically larger volume than said laws combat voter fraud 
0,why are people trying to remove voter id laws instead of removing the limitations on poor people to get their id s  if you lock yourself out of your car you do nt decide to remove all the locks you keep a spare key somewhere 
0,i find it troubling how partisan the language in the paper s conclusion is at one point  the authors state that  there is a desperate need for hard  empirical evidence  but then go on to say with what seems to be a high degree of confidence that white americans have a growing influence in the political process whereas racial minorities are finding it harder to vote  the fact that this paper is such an outlier when compared to similar studies on the relation between voter id requirements and turnout is concerning when paired with the rhetoric used by the authors of this paper 
0,so organize and get people registered and out to vote they did it in the 1960 s why can not it be done now 
0,well duh  if the repugs are responsible for implementing anything  then by definition it s biased against democrats and minorities the gop  the party of old  rich  white people oh yeah  add in scared to that list 
0,i understand both arguments being made in this thread i think a politically easy solution to solve all of this would be to create an automatic voter registration where every individual can have a voter id shipped to their house when they are 17  to participate in primary if they are 18 by election day   does anyone know how much a federal program like this would cost 
0,why does rpolitics suck europe s dick when it comes to healthcare and taxes but completely ignore the average european reaction to learning that the usa does nt require id to vote 
0,funny  in my poor ass town no one had issues coughing up id when it came time to get booze 
0,no shit
0,when elections teeter on a couple points and billions are spent campaigning  i d think it a pretty easy strategy to go get those people ids 
0,so they do exactly what they were intended to do 
0,id laws also suppress people who need to drive a car  open a bank account  buy booze  rent movies from a store  validate credit card purchases  get a legit job  get married maybe having an id is nt so bad 
0,what is the data on voter fraud  last i heard  there s not much of it at all and that the premise is largely baseless 
0,how the hell is asking for an id a bad thing  this will always confuse me you need an id for pretty much everything 
0,something that applies to everyone equally  is racist   read more about it 
0,by using that logic so does the act of voting itself i ca nt believe they make people get out of their house and go to a place and vote what about people with no legs  what about the people who ca nt read 
0,it s not in the constitution anywhere that says americans are free from having to have documents i think people are imposing liberties that never existed  i think the far left often uses this tactic to fool people in the middle  i do nt see it as unreasonable to actually enforce the law when determining who s running the country i do nt understand why i m supposed to let voter fraud be even a possibility instead  people will claim things like racism  rightwing conspiracy  or something else that convinces me the moderates are being tricked 
0,this just in  water is wet 
0,they re modern day jim crow laws
0,voter fraud is real
0,gt   not only can costs be controlled  medicare  controls costs  by limiting what it will pay for  regardless of what the doctor treating a patient thinks their patient needs to survive 
0,look at everyone of bernie s positions i believe every single one has well over a 50  approval from the general population 
0,here s bernie s talking points  1 universal health care sanders backs a singlepayer   medicareforall  system  saying that  america must join the rest of the industrialized world and provide health care for all  2 federal intervention in flint  mich sanders condemns the water contamination crisis  saying it is stunting children s development he calls for the resignation of michigan gov rick snyder  r  and says   if the local government can not protect those children  if the state government can not protect those children  then the federal government better get in  3 minimum wage sanders calls the current federal rate of  725  a starvation wage  and says it should be raised to  15 an hour  4 wealth inequality sanders decries the disparity between families like the waltons  who own walmart  and most americans he has offered several changes to the tax code to address the gap  5 jail population sanders noted that the united states has the largest incarcerated population in the world and says that will no longer be the case if he is president  6 planned parenthood funding while republicans want to  defund  the women  s health organization  which has been caught up in a controversy over abortion services  sanders wants to expand its funding  7 samesex marriage sanders pledges to protect new rights in all 50 states for gay couples to marry  8 paid family and medical leave sanders wants to guarantee three months of paid leave after the birth of a child  9 federal jobs program sanders wants to spend  1 trillion to create 13 million jobs to  rebuild our crumbling infrastructure  10 child care sanders wants to invest more money to create a  worldclass  childcare system  11 trade policy sanders cites his past opposition to nafta and other  disastrous  deals and vows to fight the pending transpacific partnership being championed by president obama  12 prosecute wall street offenders sanders bemoans how financial giants like goldman sachs could pay a  5 billion settlement for fraudulent behavior without any of its executives going to jail  13 marijuana policy sanders wants to remove marijuana from the federal government  s list of dangerous drugs and allow states to decide whether to legalize possession without intervention by washington  14 voting rights sanders opposes efforts by republican governors to impose additional barriers to voting  says those who do should  get another job  15 supreme court appointment with a vacancy created by the unexpected death of justice antonin scalia  sanders urges republicans to  obey the constitution  and consider for confirmation any nominee put forward by president obama  16 campaign finance reform sanders wants the supreme court to overturn the citizens united decision  which allows unlimited campaign contributions he says that would be a litmus test for any new justice he appoints  17 free college tuition sanders calls for making tuition free at public universities and colleges and says lower interest rates should be available for those who currently have debt for  the crime of getting a college education  18 tax on wall street speculation sanders proposes a tax on wall street trades  saying it  s the financial sector  s turn to help out the middle class after being bailed out by taxpayers after the 2008 meltdown  19 climate change sanders says policymakers have a  moral obligation  to curb emissions contributing to the warming of the planet  20 iraq war sanders argues that the us invasion destabilized the middle east and says his 2002 vote against it shows his judgment on foreign policy he also argues that if the country can spend so much on the war  it can invest in other priorities at home 
0,i legitimately ca nt decide which political move is more out of touch with reality  1 hillary boasting about having henry kissenger s support  2 jeb using george w on the campaign trail  it s madness it s absolute madness 
0,so this is just jeb s final hail mary move  right 
0,the other night trump was met which a chorus of boos for daring to challenge the conservative spin that  george w kept our country safe  trump pointed out that 911 occurred during the bush regime  despite warnings from the cia that this attack was imminent in a report titled   osama bin laden destined to strike in the united states  or something like that  trump also pointed out that bush s destabilizing influence is what created isis and emboldened terrorists in that destabilized region  which is also tantamount to not exactly keeping us safe  the howl of horrified boos from the audience was amazing  as though each of them was drinking the same koolaid
0,the really sad thing is that w looks like winston churchill compared to current crop of gop candidates
0,we need to dispel this notion that jeb bush knows what he s doing jeb bush has no fucking clue what he is doing 
0,jeb needs to get his mommy to help him campaign  and when that does nt work he calls in his brother who is nationally regarded as responsible for many of the problems we face as a country today  please clap 
0,jeb s mother told him to have george speak 
0,remember w was handed a surplus in 2001 and squandered it with incredibly irresponsible tax cuts during time of war the us is the only country in the history of the world to cut taxes during time of war conservatives have no standing to complain about the national debt because largely they caused it  now that we are in the paul ryan era  the budget deficit and national debt any more is absolutely intentional because they will use it to justify cuts in social security and medicare and anything else that does nt benefit the 1   it s the grover norquist method 
0,did you guys watch the speeches  i think it helped him people who do nt want anything to do with the bush family can snicker all they want  but it was definitely a plus for jeb bush has a 70  approval rating with republican voters it ll help with the nomination at least  w warmed up the crowd and jeb had a tough act to follow and it lit a flame jeb has never spoken with so much furor before it s a newer jeb  but probably too late to change much but  if jeb continues with the same confidence as yesterday he could climb to 2nd place rationally  in the very least it bought in the spotlight and people actually can hear about jeb s stance on things 
0,funny how the american media ca nt write stories like these but then  they would have to implicate themselves in absolute failure that was 43 s presidency 
0,i picture jeb  not wanting george to campain for him  but being to bashful to tell him 
0,you know it s bad when you re bringing in dubya to help out on the campaign trail 
0,it s also a reminder that the  burn it all down  mentality has its consequences people did protest votes against gore and the country has  in fact  burn to the ground in many respects a full  third  of our debt   66trillion  is from the bush tax cuts alone  and another 10    17trillion  is from the war in iraq we re looking at thousands dead and maimed servicemen and women and a foreign policy that has directly contributed to the rise of isis and islamic extremism in the middle east civil liberties have been rolled back with the usa patriot act  usa is part of the acronym   and bushappointed alito is practically trying to outcompete thomas for archconservative on the court  which gave us citizens united and nearly derailed the aca 
0,i saw this story in australia and thought  oh well if another bush gets in at least we might get four more years of quality punk songs after an eight year hiatus 
0,desperation does funny things to a guy 
0,anybody else watch the sean hannity interview with jeb  and george while thinking to themselves   thank god  yahweh  allah  shiva  buddha  zeus  odin  and anyone else listening that man is nt president anymore  
0,i really think it s time for the us to have more political parties it s pretty obvious that both republicans and dems are sick and tired of their own parties we got a guy who calls himself a socialist and a real estate tycoon reality show star as front runners time for a reality check 
0,of course he s going to support his brother it s crazy to think he would nt 
0,george w did nt disappear from the public stage for nothing 
0,best part of the evening   i do nt know about you  but i really like bushes    sen lindsey graham
0,i m legit laughing at this headline  well put guardian 
0,i dont care what the polls say jeb has no chance of winning 
0,the  disastrous legacy  is being countered by a complete rewrite of history source  cnn all day long 
0,during dubya s speech yesterday i was having serious ptsd flashbacks never again 
0,dubya has nt aged well saw him on tv last night and he looks every one of his 69 years 
0,w and cheney and rumsfeld should all be indicted as war criminals the decision to invade iraq was the greatest blunder in american history and we will paying the dividends for at least another generation 
0, my father kept our country safe   jeb   tough guy  bush  outstanding applause

0,what kind of article is this  why would nt gwb support jeb  they re brothers for fucks sake this is nt some big story that needs to be told 
0, labels are for soup cans   dubya campaigning for jeb  see he still has nt lost that idiot charm

0,you forgot poland 
0,it woud nt surprise me if jeb  places 2nd and then starts the beginning of a comeback 
0,obama looks at bush   it s not my fault  he roped me into it  bush looks at clinton   well he roped me into it  clinton plays his saxophonewearing a small badge that reads  first black president 
0,just to remind people what the george w bush presidency was really like  lie on top of lie  https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  yykc4gd2id4 also  the lehman brothers subprime mortgage scheme that drained  7t out of the us economy  sending the us into the great recession of 2008 was concocted early in the bush presidency  somebody will eventually write the true history and legacy of the bush family  from george hw bush to george w bush  and it will expose a family that very nearly destroyed the us 
0,i am not which president in my lifetime has a anything but a disastrous legacy even obama is nt going to be remembered fondly for some of the actions of the us during his presidency  if anything he seemed to double down on everything bush did wrong
0,i swear to god  barbara had to be smoking weed or eating lead paint chips while pregnant with those two w looks like he s got mange on the top of his head  and i love how laura just stands there next to him  without a clue  waving like a retard at everyone  she looks great by the way  regardless of what people try to say now  george w bush was one of the worst president s this country has ever had there s a mile long list of horrifically bad things his administration brought about  from 911 to the patriot act colin powell and rumsfeld were the only two competent people who came out of that administration  do nt forget  cheney created the nsa and the psychotic nsa contractor where the concept of ass raping and torturing innocent americans is somehow making us all safe 
0,7 years later  still blaming bush 
0,george w bush belongs in the hague  as do cheney and rumsfeld 
0,its his brother  its not surprising its like bill supporting hillary 
0,here a question for you would rather have uday or quesy running iraq after daddy saddam gets old and has heart attack like scalia 
0,one of the worst humans and presidents ever  what a total moron  thanks for destroying the lives of generations of americans 
0,umm  what does this have to do with how much hillary sucks and how awesome bernie is and how he s going to save america  stay on topic please 
0,seriously you ca nt bark like a dog while running for president it is a bad move 
0,who is nt 
0,hillary trolls bait in water  giant puffer fish donald trump bites on 
0,i think you misspelled  looking  you spelled it  barking 
0,no wonder he s many sanders supporters  second choice 
0,where can i stream this  i do nt have msnbc and i love joe and mika
0,ruh roh 
0,trump is just on another level love it 
0,i do nt know why they d panic in sc  unless internal polling shows a sure sanders win in nv and they re worried about sanders getting a bump from a nv win 
0,maybe she can get some xanax from her pharma buddies 
0,yes  she s barking mad 
0,interesting  mine seems to be subsiding 
0,looooooooool  i love this  literally two posts above this one is a cnn link that says   in south carolina  big leads on both sides  so now is clinton really having a panic attack on sc or is the media lying to us  you decide 
0,there s no  panic attack  she s winning  easily 
0,what if a guy just wants a wank 
0,all you morons going off about how this woman is the devil for doing this is too funny to me you dumbasses do nt even see the point of what this bill represents 
0,its funny i thought this a was a democrat proposing this just goes to show extreme upwards towards authoritarian the wings of the democratrepublican bird go up now
0,why do these lawmakers have the urge to control people s choices 
0,man  i do nt know how many of yall get stuck listening to conservative radio  but why are like half of their ads about ed meds why do so many conservative men have trouble getting it up 
0,judging by her picture  she wo nt have to worry about any man getting a woody she s definitely a twobagger 
0,there is no equivalence between  abortion  and  viagra   this is yet another unserious argument from the regressive left 
0,this woman should be broke  jobless and homeless for this
0,what a fucking twat 
0,sanders straight up said that if warren does nt run  or another progressive  that he would run no one stepped into the race so he did 
0,and i think 99  of bernie sanders  supporters would be just as happy  if not happier  with warren 
0,i believe they probably have discussed this between the two of them and decided that bernie would run for whatever reasons 
0,most bernie supporters wanted her first it is not that they do nt want hillary because she is a woman  they do nt want her because she is calculating rather than principled  opportunistic as opposed to moral 
0,he s going to make her secretary of the treasury  hopefully 
0,if sanders loses this election  she will win in 2020 by a 51 margin 
0,if she ran she would have won 
0,please give bernie some credit for daring this  radical  campaign   i do nt think it was an battle to lose to begin with and it is nt now i admire his courage more 
0,i knew and loved warren before i ever heard of sanders  but i think he has a better chance than warren would ve while he has the age and jewish thing against him  warren has almost no history in politics compared to clinton  elected to senate in 2013  and the difference would ve been far starker 
0,actually  i think she did nt run  because he is they re definitely similar  and i would like to see her do big things in years to come i think they re paving the way for each other to make revolutionary changes she makes me so proud to be form massachusetts 
0,warren is most effective in the senate 
0,i love warren for the same reason i love sandersunvarnished straight talk that is both believable and not self serving both of them are people i would want to be friends with because i feel i could call them when facing a difficult decision or moral dilemma and get some advice that would likely solve the problem  i feel that clinton would give me advice she could either profit from or use against me in the future 
0,sanderswarren 2016 
0,i m not sure she would have a chance against clinton though the reason bernie has been so effective is because of his recordrhetoric she does nt have the record 
0, great men do not seek power they have power thrust upon them 
0,please  please  i beseech you all  stop with the vp talk it will not happen and should not happen warren far more valuable and powerful in the senate 
0,alright  i got ta jump in here i know that most of reddit absolutely loves warren  but she is just as big of a politico as clinton or rubio i m from a small suburb of boston  and i guarantee if you mentioned it to her  she would nt know where it is she does nt do much  in my opinion  for the commonwealth she represents  opting instead to work for national causes  she s a carpet bagging technocrat from harvard law who was crowned  just like clinton  by the dnc amp  dccc to take ted kennedy s seat back from scott brown  who won it by beating the last anointed ma senate candidate  martha coakley  who was acting like hrc is now when she was campaigning  like she inherited the job   i know on the national stage she is a progressive hero  but as somebody she is supposed to represent right now  i feel that she is using massachusetts like so many other aspirational politicians  patrick  romney  brown  callahan  etc   stepping on our heads on the way to dc 
0,warren for vp 
0,i m really hoping sanders picks her as a running mate  if she d accept   she s a fabulous politician though having her in the senate may allow her to affect more 
0,warren for vp  sanders  warren 2016
0,if he would pick her for vp i d lose it that s the dream team 
0,could there be a sanderswarren ticket 
0,was nt sanders recruited to run by the people who started the draft warren group after she firmly declined to run 
0,i would bet that if bernie wins the nomination warren will be top choice for vpgiven bernie s age it would be a coup if she accepted 
0,i identify as a pretty middleoftheroad independent  socially liberal  fiscally conservative  and i d feel a hell of a lot better voting for warren than sanders 
0,in what world does clinton s remark at the end make sense  you ca nt criticise the current president because you re in the same party  does she really expect that kind of partisanship  does she think it s a good thing 
0,bernie is only running because elizabeth did nt 
0,i have nt looked in a while but it seems as these two are very compatible as politicians maybe they could go as running mates 
0,ever consider that maybe elizabeth warren did nt run because bernie was going to run 
0, if thing that did not happen had happened  then other thing that did happen might not have happened  great reporting 
0,i recall bill maher offering her 1 million dollars if she ran 
0,sometimes  deficit spending is a democratic socialist 
0,i thought the bill press interview was super interesting is it possible to get a link for the full version 
0,she might get nominated for the scotus vacancy 
0,there were a ton of people who should have run  but did nt bother because the process seemed set up for hillary to win who saw kerryedwards coming in 2004  historically way more people on both sides have been willing to give it a shot and see how it goes  turning the nominating process into hillary s coronation was a huge mistake 
0,i was all in for warren  signed the petition to ask her to run she said no and we got bernie happy with either one
0,elizabeth warren is the goldman sach s wolf in sheep s clothing do nt buy into her bullshit 
0,i ve been a bernie fan since he arrived in congress in 1991 but i would have been perfectly happy with warren as a candidate she s better known and bernie did not want to run i listened to the onceaweek brunch with bernie hour on the thom hartmann radio show and bernie kept hoping a progressive like warren would run when no one came forward  he began talking about running himself 
0,so sanders runs because he feels he must  that the country needs his policies and pretty much every other candidate in either party runs because of personal ambition 
0,we are even i m shrugging off hillary 
0,this is what makes me think her supporters are so gullible she s playing them like a trumpet and they still defend her like she s the moral  pragmatic choice good luck 
0,well  to be fair  those fees are just a drop in the bucket when you consider the clintons  massive haul
0,does anyone believe that hilary clinton was not going to run for president 
0,let s talk about how secretary of state was too much for her and had her contemplating leaving politics multiple times 
0,staaahhhhhp
0,does nt this simply show that people are willing to pay a lot of money to hear hillary s views  and that wall street has a lot of respect for her global perspective  regardless of her policy proposals   i know it s easy to paint her as prowall street for this  but getting paid for a speech is far from lobbying for wall street or being  bought and paid for  anyone familiar with her platform would know that  i would be more skeptical if she spoke for free 
0,not even a group or specific names just  community leaders   this is what qualifies as good in rpolitics
0,election day is on taco tuesday 
0,but warren still missing in action 
0,27 upvotes and no comments  must be a shitty article inflating bernie somehow   reads headline  ooooh  it s a shitty article shilling the fact that a latino supports bernie  take that hillary  where is your minority support now  edit  s
0,he may win right there  but will that end racism  will that end sexism 
0,its true  i bet we got more ground game than hillary  when i attended a volunteer seminar recently we had lots of volunteers and almost all of them had never volunteered for a political campaign before  myself included 
0,ok fine bernie  you may win georgia  but  wouldthatendracism 
0,in gon na vote in georgia to make sure bernie wins    that man is amazing 
0,if the blacks give this to hillary  this liberal bernie loving redditor will vote for trump and let them get what they deserve 
0,great article  let s upvote it   i only read the title 
0,i ve never met anyone in real life that knows who elizabeth warren is  which is unfortunate 
0,squatting squaw makes big movement
0,hillary s biggest foe in this election is google 
0,the hillary campaign is about hillary becoming president like she deserves it or something like us electing her is just completing some prophecy that hillary has waited her whole life to fulfill she reminds me of frank underwood in house of cards  the sanders campaign is not about giving sanders something  its about sanders giving the country something he doesnt act like we owe him something  he acts like we owe ourselves something 
0,the clinton s are using old scare tactics and smear campaigning from the 90s but with the birth of the internet and quickfact checking  the clintons have destroyed their own campaign more than anyone else has 
0,wow i feel like most people wo nt have time to read the whole thing  but this is really insightful and well written  if you sort through enough trash  salon can really surprise you with some great stuff once in a while 
0,welcome to the information age  where your past words and exploits are but a click away and your facts and arguments that played so well to a captive audience  are disseminated and refuted within 24 hours and before they ve had their chance to sway voters 
0,sometimes i feel like candidates are running their campaigns like the marketing tactics of the early 2000 s are still effective on today s audiences not saying they are immune  but just like movie going audiences demand newer and more impressive things  consumers  especially younger  have grown up under a bombardment of the most sophisticated and fine tuned marketing the world has ever seen sometimes i do nt think most politicians this cycle have really kept up in bernie s case you have a good product but who knows  my state has nt seen it s primary yet so maybe i have nt got to experience the big guns 
0, her backers harp on her experience  but experience only counts if you learn from it  ouch 
0,did anyone else cringe a little bit when hillary named mandela as the foreign leader who would influence her foreign policy then hamhandedly segwayed into how she thinks bernie disrespects obama  it seemed like such a pander to the  mostly black  audience in south carolina that cost her the nomination there in 2008  i was happy that bernie forcefully defended himself there and told her he s supported obama throughout his term but  as a us senator  had a duty to the people to question the president in certain issues that s bernie s commitment to democracy over politics  something hillary does nt get 
0,i think her problem is that her understanding of how to do politics is quintessentially out of date she thinks you trade favors for progress she thinks you identify with people by feigning a common identity most damaging  imo  is that she still thinks of herself as part of an oppressed class all that seems corrupt and fake today 
0,let s dispel with this fiction that the clintons do nt know what they re doing they know exactly what they re doing 
0,nothing is more powerful than an idea whose time has come  this killed hillarys campaign in 2008 as democrats were euphoric over electing the first black president  and undecided  independent voters were leery of the clinton brand and the negatives that come with it  its 2016 wall street greed sucker punched the world to its knees in 2008 young voters are looking at a  still  broken health care system  staggering college loan debt  skyrocketing housing costs  stagnant wages in a time of record corporate profits and trillion dollar cash hoards  and hillary clinton  while repeatedly cashing enormous speaking engagement checks and donations from wall street and big healthcare  pharma  keeps attempting to tell voters that she is the change agent that will fix wall street and healthcare  bernie sanders is like a genie that popped out of the bottle at exactly the right moment in time  who appeals to all the voters put off by clinton for reasons i just mentioned 
0,she lost iowa in 2008 and won new hampshire and had a smaller national lead 
0,lets have our site slowly step down line by line and then after its done moving the text you are trying to read all around it will pop open a video ad on top

0,sanders need to show his birth certificate
0,i think clinton would make a really good   gop   candidate  especially considering the current field of gop candidates 
0,gt   clinton  may be obama  s heir  but sanders is fdr  s i really like this line succint case of traditional liberalism vs neoliberalism 
0,you ca nt sling mud at teflon it just wo nt stick 
0,it feels like a lot of people on this thread think the entire world uses reddit and thus hate clintonsupport sanders young people are notorious for not voting because they rather make memes and facebook posts about who they think should be potus and call it a day 
0,hillary comes across on tv as a complete liar her body language and fake cackling laugh just sets alarm bells off in any reasonable person  coupled with videos of her saying one thing then lying to give the opposite impression  she simply comes across as a richard nixon clone 
0,well  it looks like hillary1000 is due for a software update 
0,i dislike salon but damn that s a fair  great piece 
0,dae boo hillary

0,man  that site really shat up my browser  afraid i was unable to read the article 
0,not sure why she s bothering  as she s guaranteed the nomination 
0,somebody does nt want to campaign on not doing his job 
0, he advised the president to nominate someone who has  an almost identical resume and capabilities of justice scalia   funny  did nt hear shit like this when they installed uber conservative clarence thomas to replace uber liberal thurgood marshall 
0,i think it is pretty hilarious that this is being referred to as a  conservative seat  on the scotus that s not actually how that works 
0,yeahbut only because he thinks they should nt automatically reject a scalia clone  should obama nominate one 
0,he wo nt be the last to break ranks too many of them are vulnerable in the election to hold the supreme court hostage while they re trying to campaign it would be a talking point at every rally or debate they went to  and it s a damned near impossible position to defend as anything other than   i do nt like obama  so i m preventing the highest court in the land from operating properly 
0, if he puts forth someone that we think is in the mold of president obama  s vision for america  then we  ll use every device available to block that nomination   tillis said he advised the president to nominate someone who has  an almost identical resume and capabilities of justice scalia   wtf  that is just plain stupid  dude  your team lost the election 
0,gt   if he puts forth someone that we think is in the mold of president obama  s vision for america  then we  ll use every device available to block that nomination   tillis said he advised the president to nominate someone who has  an almost identical resume and capabilities of justice scalia  being obstructionist until you get what you want without compromise is still being obstructionist he s not  breaking ranks   he s trying to  sound  reasonable while still being gop kuckoo for coco puffs
0,must not be up for reelection 
0,welp  we ve finally done it  reached the point where a republican politician behaving  normally  is so outside the norm  it s breaking news 
0,gop calling their own tactics obstructionist  what s the temperature in hell right now 
0,the gop is putting their heads on blocks here ideally they get obama to nominate someone moderate then slow play until after the election if the dem wins they ratify obama s nom in a lame duck session if the republican wins they table the whole thing and their guy gets a pick  by outright refusing they open the door to obama not nominating anyone  or nominating a dream liberal who they ca nt support either way they look like the aholes who refused point blank before they knew what the offer was obviously this will be decided by the election  which is a startlingly democratic idea   i know obama should get this pick  but he really does nt have any leverage here  it s a political reality  what they should have done is suggest a dream nominee of their own an idea obama  or any president  could nt support then it s a dirty political fight on both sides and congress can play some offense during election season their is no rule that says they ca nt suggest a nominee 
0,yes  obstruct the nominee let the nominee be another symbol of what republicans have brought to the table over the last 7 years the republican party is a national disgrace 
0, this is not a case of a republican being righteous   http  wwwnewsobservercomnewspoliticsgovernmentarticle60375981html 
0,how dare he use such an accurate and exact term 
0,gt  gop lawmaker willing to give us empty lip service 
0,is being obstructionist illegal 
0,how many more do we need  like 4 
0,evidently tillis does nt really understand that it still obstructionism saying you re going to use every device available to block a nomination unless obama picks someone in the mold of scalia or it s just typical gop doublespeak saying his party wo nt be obstructiveas long as they get what they want  assholes man 
0,overblown he s simply giving the logical answer  yeah  we ll listen to him we ll still veto him  but we ll listen first 
0,wow  i was nt expecting the senator to be tillis maybe he s cognizant that he ll probably have a strongly contested election in 2020  because i had him pegged as a bit extreme 
0,they voted for revolutionary change  they got a vetocracy 
0, and there  when i had fallen furthest from the mouth of the cave  when i thought all hope for my rescue had fallen away  there i saw a light a small  flickering light far in the distance it called to me  faintly  but in the echoes of my tomb it might as well have been an orchestra  here here there is hope 
0,really  either he s retiring or he s not up for reelection for a while 
0,it will be very interesting how this whole thing shakes out i saw an article about rand paul saying that obama has a conflict of interest in appointing a sc nominee since many of the cases the scotus will be reviewing are dealing with which powers the president does and does not have obama will pick someone who has similar views to himself  but it will be interesting to see what their thoughts on presidential powers is 
0,and what is this persons name so that we can honor him 
0,sounds more like message refinement than a break from the party 
0,somebody is about to get primaried
0,too many of them are vulnerable in the saturday night massacre 
0,please note tillis is not opposed to senate republicans blocking obama from appointing anyone to be the next supreme court justice tillis is against saying it out loud 
0,where is chuck schumer when you need him ca nt we just filibuster for  oh say  18 months 
0,the  r  s just need to find a guy who uses terms like  jiggery pokery  and  pure applesauce  in legal opinions on a regular basis 
0,it is funny watching a dying party desperately exercise what power they have even if it makes them look like fools and only hurts their cause  btw my comments are related to how childish and foolish the party has acted in the last 5 years or so not saying they are going anywhere long term but it is just crazyness 
0,its also just unwise if they block his pick long enough  he ll just make a recess appointment while they re on one of their many vacations boom  senate oversight bypassed its ugly  but they re playing ugly 
0,is this buzzfeed  wtf is this click bait shit 
0,i feel that a progressive party would be inclusive to conservatives who understand social living and liberals who can fathom rural living the gop and democratic party have spent too much time forcing a false choice  imho 
0, we would strongly prefer you nominate the ghost of antonin scalia 
0, we should consider who obama nominates  but if they are nt exactly who we want based of our political ideology  we will block it  sore fucking losers they need to come back to the real world and realize that moderation and compromise run a government 
0, reads title  wow a pragmatic sane republican  reads article   if he puts forth someone that we think is in the mold of president obama  s vision for america  then we  ll use every device available to block that nomination  annnnnnnnd he s back
0,when i grow up  i want to be a senator so i can fillibuster  obstruct  and delay others from doing their jobs for as long as possible 
0,so this is how it s going to be  endless posts about this  despite nothing actually happening yet 
0,great  now we just need to get 4 more with a conscience and we can get a justice passed 
0,a rare conservative who actually fears his voters will reign him in for not doing his job  must be a swing state con 
0,this this is what made you think you re obstructionists  
0,  are we the baddies     https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  hn1vxamejru 
0,all any gop politician had to do is remark how they look forward to president obama s nomination to fill this important position and hope and pray he will select a person that s a compromise between their and his views then claim any brought forward are too far to the left of  central  america view over and over until president obama s final year is up  now all you can do is hold you re breath while the rest of america goes blue 
0,oh  so republicans are the victims here   facepalm 
0, nevertheless  tillis put a high bar on what kind of nominee the party should be willing to consider  saying a nominee with an identical resume and capabilities of justice scalia  would be worth a vote 
0,i d rather walk into the senate and find 100 obstructionists  throwing rocks at one another  than 80 old men giving each other handjobs on top of suitcases full of lobbists  money  but i m pretty sure which is more likely 
0, by which i mean to say that we should under no circumstances  appear  to be what we are  but we should definitely not confirm anyone lacking the strongest possible conservative  even theocratic  resume

0,well canada is in america  along with mexico  all of the central american countries and of course south american countries 
0,the fact that senate republicans will attempt to block an obama nominee is no surprise what is surprising is the assertion that he should nt even attempt to replace justice scalia  even though he has nearly a year left in office it s as though somehow that would be unseemly to leave the supreme court without a tie breaking vote until 2017 is not in the best interest of the country 
0,this is literally one of the things i specifically voted for 
0,gt  senate inaction likely means the court will be without one justice for two terms the next supreme court term will be nearly half over when the next president is sworn in  and even if that president nominates quickly  confirmation is unlikely before the term  s end that means two years of potential 44 deadlocks that leave the court unable to decide major constitutional issues thus refusing to even vote on a nominee is not just an abdication of constitutional duty  it will manufacture a constitutional crisis  this should be the lede senate inaction could split the court 44 for the 20152016 term and the 20162017 term sitting on this nomination means it ll be   october of 2018   before the court opens a term with a full bench 
0,minor point but is nt this incorrect  gt  scalia is the first supreme court justice to die midterm since robert jackson in 1954 rehnquist died on the bench in 2005 
0,reps are inna pickle  they either scorch earth obama s pick and bet they get the wh next year  or hedge and comprimise on a moderate obama may slip a more moderate person in if they hedge their bets  but where it s going either  next dem inserts way more liberal that obamas pick or  r  win the wh and can put a conservative judge in  but that is in turn  betting on trump s continued koolaid wallsmashing rise to the presidency  so i got ta ask em do you feel lucky 
0,if the late justice had died on january 15th of next year  ok  they might have a point at that point it s a week until inauguration  nothing s going to get done in that time  but it would be classy to consult with his successor to get the process started a week sooner  but cmon guysinauguration is 11 12 months away insisting on it now is just plain childish 
0,appoint and nominate do nt mean the same thing 
0,regardless of your liberalconservative views  one of the main reasons supreme court justices have lifetime appointments is so that they may adjudicate  free from political influence this whole debate that is currently raging was never supposed to have occurred in the first place as the nominee is supposed to be someone who is the most qualified for the job in both the eyes of the president and the senate conservative or liberal  it was nt supposed to matter 
0,suppose that the gop wins the presidency but the democrats recapture the senate does anyone really think that if the democrats vote down every nominee for 4 years that the republicans will just say   well  that s just the senate doing their constitutional duty to advise and consent boy this is hard  i hope we can find a reasonable agreement on a suitable replacement   hell no  they would rage out  part of why our political system mostly works in this country is that for over 200 years even bitter rivals have been able to act in a manner which reflects respect for civic duty when that broke down once before  more than 600000 people died to resolve the dispute  if the senate does nt consider nominees to the supreme court in good faith  they risk the entire political system crashing down civil wars have been fought over less than this 
0,whether or not you are a fan of president obama  it is his responsibility to present a nominee to fill the vacancy a full year without even a name provided would be gross negligence on his part  imho there are good  qualified candidates for the position and there are issues that need to be adjudicated without danger of a 44 nondecision

0,actually  we had elections in 2010  2012 and 2014  they resulted in the currently republican held senate  who has to confirm anyone obama might nominate

0,whether im in one of my libertarian moods or proconsumer liberal moods  im proud to always disagree with paul krugman 
0,i think that krugman simply fails to see what s happening  that sleepy america is gradually waking up to the fact that its system of government is badly broken and has to change krugman is a very smart economist  but he s looking at things through the prism of  business as usual  bernie s underlying premise is that  business as usual  has failed government needs to change  and he is leading the call for change it is about  the will of the people 
0,sanders clearly has  happy dreams   why else would he pay his interns less than the  15hour minimum wage he wants to force on the country 
0,to be fair  krugman s a staunch neoliberal so of course he s going to speak out against bernie s economic plans

0,hillary delivers her hot button issues often repeated but with no details of how she could end racism or sexism she likes to talk about both 
0,electing obama did nt end racism  electing hillary wo nt end sexism  and electing bernie wo nt end antisemitism  so how about we vote on platforms rather than which bathroom the candidate uses 
0,it d be nice if the article included some context 
0,so apparently hillary clinton is going to end racism and sexism  that s what she s implying i think we can all see what s she s doing and how she s taking advantage of people it s really exploitative and toxic clinton does nt know how to not be a racist

0,gt  debunked this assertion with data showing that fewer than 1 in 10 abortion providers are in majorityblack neighborhoods the black population is largely concentrated into fairly tight areas  and make up less than 12  of the us population it would be interesting to see what percentage of black people as a whole have an abortion clinic in their zip code  zip was what was used in this  study   vs white people  to be a majority black neighborhood there would have to be quite a few black people there since their usage means that black people made up of 50  or more of the neighborhood  it could be 49  black  48  hispanic and they would nt consider it  majority black  
0,social programs do nt lift people out of poverty you do nt even need to be a republican to see that social programs are just to keep people alive and off the streets 
0,does anyone know if conservatives  particularly republicans in the south  have some kind of more subtle agenda  s  beneath the veneer of  prolife  and  limited government   attempts to impede women s access to care in 2016 is so absurd that i often wonder if the motivations are deeper than just ignorancesexismracism  religion  and political ideology the ultimate consequences of interfering with women s health rights are so obviously ass backwards and to the detriment of society it makes my head explode  it would nt surprise me if many of these bastard politicians view such actions as a long term investment in their criminal justice systems and keeping their prisons filled  among other sinister motives  do these states  by chance  happen to reap any federal benefits from rampant populations growth  i know many red states get heavy federal subsidies it feels like there s more to it than concern for the  sanctity of life   perhaps i underestimate racism in the south 
0,funny  the only time i have personally heard the claim that planned parenthood was a conspiracysecret genocide of black people was from a professor that focused on black studies and who was herself black i also got to know a student who looked up to said professor as a mentor they both shared some of the most backwards  fuckedup  blmesque stances i have ever seen  this is not a conservative or liberal issue it s a misinformation issue people either make shit up to get what they want or they never bother finding out what s true or false before spouting shit to get what they want all dishonest sides will pull the same trick they want to break you down into groups so you re easier to control you can put any spin on any issue if you do nt care about the truth  here we see someone making an issue black and white while pretending to want to stop the issue from being black and white it is insane we have reached the point we have in politics everyone is contradicting themselves constantly the truth is the last thing they consider  i think the congresswoman made good points  and a gray stance would not bait as many clicks  but she is feeding the fire in her own way it is hypocritical and exhausting to see every day 
0,i love how people can talk about ethnic minorities ignorantly like they do nt fucking understand what a pregnancy is and what it means to take it to term  i remember a few years ago  political camwhore cory booker tried to live on foodstamps to prove that they were really shitty to be on and did nt do a lot for people when half these politicians are forced to work endlessly for shit hours because they do nt have the money to take time off  pay for constant checkups  carry a growing mass on their belly  gain weight  cut out their vices  smoking  drinking   stave off nausea on a regular basis  and then sit on a hospital bed in pain for multiple hours until they re shitting and their asshole tears and a kid comes out  i ll value their opinion on this as much as the opinions of the women who see what their future and what their fetuses  possible futures could look like  they can also adopt all the kids that are brought to term then given away  too just to be consistent surely that s why most of them are in the top 10

0,i do nt know about the word  target   but i  do  know that if literally anything else had such a disparate impact on the black community  the left would be endlessly crying  racism  but the left is especially good at turning a blind eye when it comes to abortion  cf most prominent democrats  abhorrent views on lateterm abortion  
0,i had a conversation with my father about this i was home a couple of month ago  he was watching fox news as normal  well  some of the blacklivesmatter stuff came up i pointed out that cops usually show up in poorer areas more and generally treat them worse he said  they are nt targetting black people  it is just more crime happens there so of course that is where cops are more prevalent  then like 20 minutes later  brain surgeon grainstorage came on saying that black communities were being targetted by planned parenthood to commit black genocide i pointed out that that they were not in those areas targetting black folk but they were in more poor areas because they have less access to proper health insurance and birth control my father vehemently believed that pp was very racist  i then pointed out that if pp was targetting blacks  why were nt the cops or vice versa  he started ranting about how he did nt want his money to go to poor people and that i did nt know what it was like in the world screamed at me like i was a child  i am a 30 year old man  i have travelled the world  i have a good job but nope  i do nt understand the world

0,if both sides of the abortion debate spent the money they spend fighting each other on ectogenesis research this entire argument would be over by now and both sides would get what they want  we d live in a society where a woman can remove an unwanted fetus and one where those unwanted fetuses do nt have to be destroyed when removed literally having your cake and eating it too  if you ever have donated to either side of the abortion debate please consider doing some research on ectogenesis and helping fund laboratories working on the technology  if we work at it we could all see a world where sexual intercourse and breeding become entirely disconnected from one another 
0,it is a simple fact that not only are abortion rates higher in countries where it is illegal  but also abortion related health complications and deaths for women increase dramatically in these places whatever your view on life  souls  zygotes being children or whatever it is a fact that making abortions safe and available reduce many immediate atrocious problems in society and the benefits clearly outweigh the cost

0,this is nt the same thing bill and hillary are married i assume probably met doing something politically active  and they grew together and nurtured each other s careers it s not surprising that both of them would dedicate their lives to politics and potentially both reach the top  the bushes  on the other hand  are related by blood  not by common interest in that case it s more like a hereditary ruler  what the op means by  close family member

0,if you re open minded to the opinions of rightwingers  i suggest reading  this   http  wwwdailywirecomnews3280sandersandtrumparesametotalitariancandidatebenshapiro   its interesting 
0,they offer the same variation of the time tested outsider vs insider rhetoric that got every president elected since the early 90s  in 2008  it was hillary the beltway insider vs obama the political outsider  in 2000  george bush was the real american  down to earth folk that gets hardworking citizens  in 1992  bill clinton was the american dream he pulled himself from poverty up to the hallowed halls  and earned his way into yale law  now in 2016  we have two candidates who tapped into that same vein and using that rhetoric to get into power it is empty promises and platitudes that amount to nothing when they have to deal with people who disagree with them on a fundamental level 
0,i seriously do nt know how people voted for trump and believed he was the best guy for the job 
0, trump loves capitalism and the stuffed crust pizza it brings into our lives   http  iimgurcomn4pozfsgifv 
0,gt  it s very important in the long run  to elect a woman for president    says 53yearold lisa mcallister  i think we ve seen that with president obama  that he s brought racial issues to the forefront that we need to have at the forefront it s more than women s turn to have a woman in the white house    obama has not brought racial issues to the forefront   whatever attention is being paid to racial issues in this country is entirely due to people recording instances of police brutality towards black people and circulating them online black lives matter would not exist if not for these recordings the fact that black lives matter exists at all during an obama presidency is a sign that he has nt done anything nearly enough to address racial issues in this country    electing a black president has not solved racism electing a woman president will not solve sexism

0,seems to be a tacit admission to voting based on feelings 
0, bernie supporters think a woman whose mind can be changed by a facebook video is a role model  you ca nt make this shit up 
0,i m willing to bet that most of hillary supporters  or any nonbernie supporters  who have nt seen a single video of bernie will at least entertain the idea of jumping ship once they do see one of his videos  i like this one in particular   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  ru3nkvvxcss 
0,as much as i like sanders over other candidates  as a nonamerican   all these articles on reddit praising sanders seem like all the politically spun election ads you can find for other candidates 
0,random black person says they are voting for bernie  to the front page
0,not sure we need to be quoting lowinformation voters here five minutes on google will tell you all of the candidates  positions if you re undecided until hearing them speak  frankly  you re a fucking moron 
0,why the fuck is a random person s opinion on the front page of rpolitics  oh  right  the bernie cult 
0,the same thing happen to mewhen i saw a donal trump video  now i m for him 
0,i would like to see some more realistic  pragmatic ideas rather than vague populist rhetoric every reddit article is the same kind of thing   bernie is right on poverty  i think it s bad to be poor  and people should be able to have money to buy things   i mean  i see a lot of complaints and virtually no plausible solutions being offered from bernie i m very skeptical of this kind of politician i appreciate his detachment from corporate benefactors in his campaign  though and  i think he does care  where i think hillary is probably a more shrewd politician rather than some compassionate visionary 
0,rsandersforpresident2
0,if this woman changed her vote entirely after watching a facebook video of hillary clinton  she d be accused of being a shill and shit on seven different ways here 
0,i like bernie  but this is rsandersforpresident or rcirclejerk material
0,wow how limited do you have to be to totally swayed by one viewing of a video 
0,voting for someone because of a facebook video nice 
0,she cared   more   about his passionoratory not about the content 
0,there is certainly an age gap going on here it seems as if the only retort that hillary supporters can muster is  young people are too naive to know that they should support clinton  this seems similar to their other arguments  eg  women who support bernie are not real feminists  men who support bernie are sexist  berniebros    considering the incredible skill that young people have in accessing good and relativelyunbiased information quickly using modern technology  the position that young people are naive or underinformed seems to fall flat considering older generations  reliance on outdated information media technologies for their information  media that is largely controlled by corporate clinton supporters  it may be that it is the older generation of voters who are both naive and underinformed  i d like to hear other people s thoughts on this 
0,i still fail to see how the sex of the potus is in any way relevant 
0,anyone who votes for hillary clinton because she s a woman is what s wrong with this country if you took even 1 hour to do some research on who your electing for to be the freaking commander and chief of our country you would realize that bernie is way more trustworthy of your vote then hillary the lord of lies 
0,a woman president lifts the glass ceiling for literally one person any president who is committed to helping women can help women  regardless of gender 
0,i know reddit just  loves  hitler comparisons by inference  but hitler  strom thurmond  even donald trump are passionate speakers that alone is not enough  i m not lumping sen sanders in that group  but i get actively pissed reading insipid supporter perspectives like this  no matter who the candidate of topic is  be it a feel the berner or a tea bagger  we get the democracy we deserve  if we do nt dug deeper than a passionate message  i fear even a donald trump could be considered a politically viable candidate 
0,this sub and the people on it are literally the worst  bernie sanders wipes his mouth politely after eating a sandwich   4500 upvotes  bunch of antitrade  ca nt do math  think taxes are only paid by businesses  free health care  even though you re 20 and have about a 00001  chance of needing serious medical coverage  wanting morons 
0,it s pretty obvious pandering here by bernies social media team  looking for the black vote ahead of sc watch this kind of racial political news hit the front page everyday 
0,i m from the uk so i do nt know too much about us politics a few months ago  i d never heard in the last of bernie sanders  but everything i have seen and heard in the last few weeks makes me hope for the sake of the us  and the world  that bernie wins  there is so much crap going on in the world right now  and he seems the only genuine chance the us people have of starting to get things right 
0,gt  sanders  support is more pronounced among young women especially one survey showed women voters under 35 preferred sanders by an almost 20point margin  while young men preferred him only by 4 points  so in fact  ms  steinem  not where all the boys are 
0,wow  the older voters in this audio are condescending as all hell to millenials 
0,hitler was also a passionate and consistent speaker  i do nt use that as my major decision point when electing someone

0,so she wants a token female in the oval office  yeah because that will solve all gender equality issues 
0,obama was a great speaker  passionate  and spoke of change  but history is useless  clearly  if no one remembers it in 8 years 
0,it s especially humorous because it s only  older democratic women  are  supposed  to go blindly hillary s way  because it s time for a woman candidate to be elected  men seem to be strangely irrelevant no  it s just that voters can actually do whatever they feel like  amazingly and bernie sanders tells the truth and we like it and hillary s simply a skilled politician  although i realize most of you poor sap s ignore it anyway but enough of them  believe me  are listening intently  and are voting with their feet for bernie 
0,people think trump is an idiot they are wrong he knows exactly what he is doing
0,make no mistake donald trump knows exactly what he s doing

0,i dont like trump and i would nt vote for him but i do kind of see why people would vote for him he does nt let people push him around  he kicked out that one blm protester for example and i i dont know if any other candidate would do that i guess he speaks to a lot of peoples frustrations

0,the matter being discussed is that teachers do not want to pay for the unions political activism  as they do nt want their money supporting the causes the union wants 
0,if the teachers union did a better job  then they would nt have to make the government force people to be members this means they have zero accountability to their members  which leads to the kind of teachers union waste and corruption we have here in chicago 
0,yeah those teacher unions are so great they are just awesome at making education better 
0,this is considered an endorsement
0,what a great endorsement for trump bush and now obama attacking him just cements him as antiestablishment 
0,president obama was very civilized about it  gt   i continue to believe mr trump will not be president and the reason is because i have a lot of faith in the american people and i think that they recognize that being president is a serious job   obama said

0,this is the same idiot that s promoting the tpp  obama doesnt get to decide who the president is 
0,jesus what is this thread  is there a lot more trump supporters here than i thought 
0,for the people here saying  this will help trump   that s what obama is aiming to do  whoever the democratic nominee is  obama  wants  himher to go up against trump in the general trump is the candidate most likely to selfimplode  even against a meek democratic candidate  let s dispel with this fiction that president obama does nt know what he s doing 
0,obama  you re fired 
0, let me insult a couple prominent members of the senate and then complain about it when they do nt follow me along when i refuse to compromise 
0,honestly  today i had a panic attack when it hit me  we ve all been treating trump like an impossible side show candidate but dear god  he could actually do it the american people really are stupid enough that he could win and not only that the man is dangerous dangerous to world peace  dangerous to minorities  dangerous to human rights  i ca nt keep laughing about this 
0,that s what happens when you create stuff like dhs and use the patriot act to crush our rights

0,let s clarify this headline  during bush  13  more people joined the government payroll under obama  it continued to grow  but only by 8   the obama years have more federal employees than the bush years the government did not get leaner  it simply got bigger slower 
0,i m a democrat but come on  that was largely a result of the 2008 crisis and a maximalist congress
0,small government

0,to be fair to obama  after all the bush govt bloating there was nt a lot let for him to do 
0,we should probably appoint a committee to carry out a study to examine just how much bureaucracy has increased oh  government  never change 
0,yea  the gop are such hypocrites 
0,that s good for bush right  government bureaucracy is good for our economy think of the new bureaucratic jobs that will become available when america s entire health care industry is absorbed by the federal government under president bernie sanders we are about to put george bush to shame as far as government growth is concerned 
0,and thus  the birth of the tea party 
0,to be clear  this link discusses the growth in the number of us bureaucratic employees  is the number of employees added to the government payroll the best metric for how big a government is  or even an adequate metric

0,send the military and the plumbers in rip that water system apart and replace it i know that will still take a while  but the city is in ruined condition major overhaul required
0,perhaps this is a reminder of what may happen when we expand government to do  everything   little considering that taxpayers do nt have enough money for  everything  i wonder what the city  county  and national governments associated with flint have spent on projects over the last 20 years that were less important than replacing lead pipes that bring water into people s homes  or understanding that the chemistry of drinking water is indeed important when lead pipes are still extant you can try to make this a democrat  republican  liberal  conservative issue  but it s really a demonstration of how government systems can go wrong when the servants of the people lose interest in their service  and the people lose sight of demanding government do basic things before it starts doing political things

0,i would be shocked if bernie wins sc
0,i think sanders will win nevada  but the polling in south carolina sets up a seemingly insurmountable gap no way he wins in sc 
0,ah yes  the reputable  lifezette 
0,if bernie wins sc  its over for hillary
0,nevada that would be closer to an upset  but even then they ve polled closely for a while now  even going back prior to iowa and nh sanders only polled behind by what  9 points or something  i firmly believe sanders will win nevada  now  if sanders wins sc  that would be an upset

0,i m wary of any presidential candidate that is not making the environment one of the top priorities in this campaign so far  there is nt a single presidential candidate that understands the significance of the environment to security and peace in the world 
0,he certainly is focusing on underlying problems he does nt understand what causes them  nor does he provide solutions that will work  but he is focused i ll give him that 
0,bernie sanders has a wonderful plan for your life every aspect of your life  you can let go and let bernie all you need to do is say   bernie take the wheel

0,all any gop politician had to do is remark how they look forward to president obama s nomination to fill this important position and hope and pray he will select a person that s a compromise between their and his views then claim any brought forward are too far to the left of  central  america view over and over until president obama s final year is up  now all you can do is hold you re breath while the rest of america goes blue 
0,oh  so republicans are the victims here   facepalm 
0, nevertheless  tillis put a high bar on what kind of nominee the party should be willing to consider  saying a nominee with an identical resume and capabilities of justice scalia  would be worth a vote

0,did nt some prohillary supporters  along with most media  say weeks ago  and for months on end  that even if bernie managed to win iowa and new hampshire that nevada would be his death knell because it had a large minority population and that bernie would nt be able to attract said minority voters  hmmm  oh now it s 80  white  great keep moving that goal post  gt  her staff repeatedly claimed that nevada was as white as the first two early states this was not only risibly false  but a clear sign that she wasn  t just lowering expectations but showing real fear she could lose nevada  february 20th ca nt come soon enough 
0,as a californian who just spent the weekend in nevada  you can tell her campaign there is getting desperate she has an ad in every tv commercial spot i d say the ratio of clinton to sanders ads were about 8  1 the one where she s  spent her life fighting for the childrens   i ve heard at least fifty times

0,maybe that s why the media is all but dismissing it it would mess up her whole diversity argument 
0,ralston is a moron i follow him pretty closely his reporting is great he always shows up and says what he sees  his analysis is yellow journalism garbage he wants page hits so he s going to spin this as a controversy when in reality he has no idea what is going on 
0,i do nt know why anyone ever claimed it was  considering how little polling was done in that state 
0,butbutsmug and condescending hillary supporters assured me that bernie could nt win in nevada  because nonwhite people 
0,bernie looks like he s about to ascend to heaven in that pic 
0,if i m hillary clinton  that s fucking scary 
0,thanks for sharing this people are unaware of what kind of movement is happening in the sanders campaign they just keep hearing  he ca nt win  but the reality is out there videos like this packing stadiums millions of individual donations the fight is nt over but clinton is scared and she s pulling out all the old tricks that keep things as the status quo talk to people  let them know 
0,i live in ypsilanti and go to school at emu the people saying this attendance was purely because of how close we are to ann arbor are ridiculous the turn out was crazy i had to work  but my brother went and said it was pretty special

0,protestors literally make trump stronger 
0,this was actually pretty awesome and holy crap  trump was right  the press wo nt mention or talk about all the terrible foul language the protester used against everyone and how she started swinging at everyone calling it now  tonight or tomorrow headline stories of  trump brings rally members to the stage to praise them for manhandling tiny female protester with excessive force 
0,talk about balls  trump has absolutely no idea what these dudes are gon na say and he gives them the mic great stuff 
0,protester used  stump the trump  it had no effect 
0,holy shit  say what you want about trump  the man can pull off a spectacle 
0,i cant believe how positive these comments are very high energy for trump 
0,  such high energy  
0,these people drive me nuts go support your own candidate or maybe protest outside the event why fuck it up for everyone else who wants to be there  attention   money    http  media2snbcnewscomjmsnbccomponentsvideo__newf_dc_trumpaud_151012nbcnewsfp1200800jpg 
0,trump is the best
0,alright   sniff   who s cutting all the onions around here 
0,this is great  what a bunch of high energy individuals who want to see their country become great again  there s an authenticity in these men and their support for trump that i do nt think any of the other candidates  besides bernie  are even close to and it speaks to trump s character  to let them come and take the mic  and show us the viewer  that trump is real  he inspires  and he s a genuine guy that truly believes in the messages he preaches  and wants to improve the lives of the average american citizen 
0,i was genuinely moved by their words i hope the video goes viral so people can see the hope that trump inspires in his fellow americans 
0,saw this live on the youtube live stream the chat was extremely excited about it 
0,that was pretty amazing
0,he brings up two random supporters to speak for him at a rally that s amazing one is a vet and the crowd went wild cheering  usa usa usa  we need this in america again 
0,we are at the dawn of the great trumpening folks maga 
0,that made me smile 
0,this was the best moment of the entire rally  trump has so much respect for the people of this country  and it really shows i m so proud to have this man running for president

0,those guys had really nice sweaters 
0,is there a nonyt source of this video  i m at work right now and yt is blocked 
0,i see the paid trump whores have arrived 
0,holy shit  what in the fuck is going on here  first of all  this video seems suspicious these guys were way too comfortable with public speaking that s literally the  1 ranked fear  over  death   and these guys were nt shook in the slightest they each had concise  thoughtout statements to make when put on the spot they independently represented different portions of the constituency feels like a planned viral event  and then i come in the comments here and it is jampacked with glowing commendations of trump no one s really talking about the protester  or the two guys just a whole lot of  wow trump is great  he has balls to let them do that    is this how trump plans to sway middle america  are we being marketed to 
0,all this is doing is encouraging simpleminded trump supporters to attack protestors in the hopes they ll get the opportunity to meet their phony hero i ca nt wait to watch trump get trounced in the general  fueled specifically by votes from the very people he denigrates 
0,holy shit take that tobacco out of your mouth when you speak
0,so far we have two comments in support of trump and his  tremendous amazingness   strange how both accounts are only hours old 
0,get a load of all the credulous rubes in this thread whoo boy 
0,what s sad is that the damage the lead poisoning causes is nt really treatable i ve heard that they can kind of remove the lead from a person s body  but the brain damage is irreversible forgot to mention that the damage is done mostly to children  because it stops their brain from developing properly  i first heard about it on npr  it was  this   http  wwwnprorg20160122463929541leadpoisoningdatesbacktoromantimes  interview  this   http  wwwnprorg20151018449747061lessonsfromafighttofixflintswatersupply  one is also pretty good 
0,the comments from the parent about the decline in their child s ability to focus and do their schoolwork was heartbreaking  the fact is that the local and state government decided to turn their heads how much did the federal government know  and how long ago  all these government officials turning their heads and acting like this whole situation is frightening to say the least why did they do it  special interests  lobbyists  was it because the majority of the community was poor and they figured nobody would care  was it racially motivated  all of the above  one has to wonder if this is happening elsewhere in the us these political officials do nt give a rat s ass about communities that do nt contribute to their campaigns  it s time for a change 
0,episode 7 of cosmos  2014  exposes the detrimental effects of lead on humans especially children house are condemn for having lead paint and here we have whole city s water system contaminated by lead and the officials stick their heads in the sand someone needs to be charged with a crime 
0,not to mention flint is in a state surrounded by fresh water 
0,that s what happens when you do nt invest in infrastructure because you think government projects are a waste of money people used to understand that if you do nt fund public works nothing works for the public 
0,is nt it weird what happens when nobody votes in elections  stuff just kinda  falls apart  just sayin
0,i attended this rally today bernie was dead on in his statements regarding flint  and america s larger problems with infrastructure and crumbling  decrepit inner cities i especially liked his proposal to employ jobless americans to repair america s failing public works 
0,why is it when hillary visits flint it s pandering but it s ok when bernie goes 
0,current year
0,flint has become the 21st century  love canal   https  enwikipediaorgwikilove_canal  state_of_emergency 
0,that story he told today at the rally was heartbreaking had me holding back tears for my fellow michiganders 
0, your town is a shithole   crowd cheers 
0,too bad sanders is nt part of the legislative branch  then he just might be in a position to do something about it 
0,it is  after all  the present year 
0,im a sanders supporter and the 1st thing i thought of was the communities response when hillary did this  my question is with all his talk wtf is bernie going to do right now not when he wins but right now  if he just talks about it honestly hes no better than hillary
0,i like how when sanders does something it s good and totally not for political reasons however  when clinton does something it s a political side show and she is only doing it to get votes 
0,i mean cmon ppl its 2016
0,well sanders  the predominant areas are all in cities controlled by one party and controlled by that same party for decades it is a real shame but it never came to light until they could try and pin it on a republican during an election cycle
0,and they knew  all the way up to the federal epa for months without telling people they were drinking poisoned water they took this time to argue over who s fault it was rather than to come up with a fix  this is nt a failure or one city or one state  it is a failure of government 
0,he s meeting with them now and he did nt know  has nt this been going on for a while 
0,got it hillary goes to flint  to see the people and condemms the situation vote grabbing just trying to get the checkoff for minorities and articles calling her out saying it was for other reasons sanders goes to flint  because he s a great man and condemms the situation  goodness out of his own heart and ttly not related to his political aspirations 
0,think how much  and of importance  will be  how much of flint  michigan s future has already been washed away with poisoned water a generation of young people whose potential has been capped by a lead ceiling they will struggle against for the rest of their lives are we not already engaged in a civil war  of which this is but one of many similar conflicts  this is not peace people at peace do not kill and maim each other with poison 
0,wow  bernie disagrees with poisoning people   just like me      feel the bern
0,the government has horribly failed their citizens what we need now  is bigger government to fix the problem 
0,i do nt like the  think about the children   line how about we re poisoning everyone in the region 
0,i am surprised that none of the billionaires in this country have thought to give back to an american city in need  the american people would love anyone who could do that public universities and private foundations could compete for the prestige of making flint great again 
0,gt  mr sanders said that he didn  t want to be  overly political  but that he had called for the resignation of gov rick snyder of michigan   if the local government can not protect those children  if the state government can not protect those children  then the federal government better   he said  oh really  well you just politicized it dipshit um is nt this a utility and a failure of local government  the federal government would do the exact same thing as the governor and delegate responsibility locally what party was running the city  nevermind i already know the answer  fuck you bernie you re so full of shit 
0,some politicians talk about getting rid of those darn regulations  one said it ll eliminate poverty if we do   i think i d like to see a few more  and maybe some funding for the people running things   unsafe lead levels in tap water not limited to flint   http  wwwnytimescom20160209usregulatorygapsleaveunsafeleadlevelsinwaternationwidehtml 
0,polifact   bernie sanders is right  flint is a shithole  
0,can we just go ahead and change the name from rpolitics to rilovebernieandsodoeseveryoneelse
0,bernie literally just vocally greentexted   gt  2016  gt  still poisoning our children 
0,i d rather hear more about this than trump whining about cruz  here is what i want to hear how bernie is going to fix flint so that it does nt happen in any other american city 
0, it s current_year   feel le bern
0,i love how clinton does this and it s obviously pandering to blacks because you know  she s racist and the devil but sanders does it and it s a great thing  what a champion of the little people    viva la revolution

0,is nt the gun he tweeted a picture of a belgian made gun  could nt even show and american made product in a tweet about america  edit  french to belgian
0,so i m assuming he s going to nominate someone that the senate has already confirmed for another position  eg  judge sri srinivasan  etc   it s hard for the senate to say someone is nt qualified when they just recently confirmed that same person  unanimously   as they did with srinivasan 970 this also makes me think that it s  not  going to be attorney general loretta lynch  since her confirmation was more of a battle  edit   here is a list   https  enwikipediaorgwikilist_of_federal_judges_appointed_by_barack_obama  of federal judges obama has appointed so far during his presidency as you can see  several of them were unanimously confirmed by the senate 
0,it is a better choice for obama to nominate a moderate  sensible pick  if he goes out on a limb  republicans will find it easy to paint the nominee as a crazy activist leftist if it s someone like sri srinivasan or paul watford  that argument is undercut  and obama can hammer the republicans for obstructing someone so obviously qualified  who they have confirmed before  
0, obama says those who say he should leave the nomination to the next president are reading something into the constitution that just is nt there  edit  accidentally double pasted text 
0,that s not really a story  it s more of a promise it s not like he s gon na say he s gon na nominate an unqualified candidate 
0,qualified  undoubtedly  moderate and fairly benign  thus forcing gop hand   we shall see 
0,what i think will happen  obama nominated srinivasan  he gets shot down in the senate on principle  wish obama would fire back with larry lessig and get him in though

0,as someone who helps people sign up for the aca  50  of the callers i get ca nt afford the premiums even with a tax credit 20  can afford it with their tax credits i would say 10  have great prices and the rest are sent to medicaid or are eligible for exemptions obviously i know those numbers are nt extremely accurate but i m just giving my input based off the calls i get 
0,the aca is better than what we had before  but it s still far from a good system millions of people still have no access to health care because they ca nt afford the insurance premiums even people with decent insurance are going bankrupt because of deductibles  copays and expensive premiums the insurance industry does nt give a shit about our health it s time to get rid of the health insurance industry it should not exist it is just a parasite 
0,you know what is the current situation with healthcare in america   44 million people in this country do not have health insurance   33 million more are under insured   29 million adults fall into the medicaid coverage gap in which 89  are from the south 45  are white 41  are full time workers 26  are from texas  source   http  kfforghealthreformissuebriefthecoveragegapuninsuredpooradultsinstatesthatdonotexpandmedicaidanupdate  this is obamacare this is the aca  i think  and i believe many would agree  that hillary s  i m going to build on the aca  is really  i m going to make sure the health insurance industry remains a critical part of our healthcare system  whether or not medicare for all  single payer is  the  solution to our healthcare crisis  it is something worth pursuing throw out those who wish to keep the status quo 
0,universal health care means that everyone has health care universal coverage means everyone has to interact with an insurance company instead of a health care professional  if you re sick do you want to see a doctor or an actuary 
0,gt   insurers may soon be on a collision course with the republican majority in the new congress insurers  often aligned with republicans in the past  have built their business plans around the law and will strenuously resist republican efforts to dismantle it since mr obama signed the law  share prices for four of the major insurance companies  aetna  cigna  humana and unitedhealth  have more than doubled  while the standard amp  poor  s 500stock index has increased about 70 percent   http  wwwnytimescom20141118uspoliticshealthlawturnsobamaandinsurersintoallieshtml  hpamp  action  clickamp  pgtype  homepageamp  module  firstcolumnregionamp  region  topnewsamp  wtnav  topnewsamp  _r  1 
0,gt  many who are covered have policies that cover only catastrophic costs  lt   this guy
0,or worse  only a percentage of a catastrophic cost  mine only pays 80   20  of omgfuckingbullshitwtfnofuckingwayfuckthis is still bullshit 
0,it a better wold  all insurance would cover is unforeseeable  catastrophic costs the fact that you need insurance to pay for things that you know you are going to need  checkups  defeats the whole point of insurance 
0,insurance is supposed to only cover catastrophic costs  it s not supposed to cover your  20 subscriptions that s not what insurance is  that s one reason why prices are so high  imagine if your car insurance company had to pay for oil changesfluidsinspectionsetc the price would rise dramitically
0,currently in nc the only health insurance provider  blue cross and blue shield  for about 1015 eastern counties is going to cease to do business there  so people with preexisting conditions who were finally able to get insurance due to the aca are now being told they will have no coverage within their own county so their only recourse is to travel hours away from their own towns and buy insurance  then whenever they get sick to drive those same hours to see a doctor at all the aca was great for a lot of reasons but it is still very lacking and we need to move forward on true universal health care  not universal health insurance 
0,insurance is expensive 
0,well we could take down the healthcare monopolies and then allow for capitalism to way down the cost allowing for healthcare providers to compete statewide would help these two would see a cost reduction and open up insurance to people who may not be able to afford it now i does nt have to be universal health care to work  it just ca nt have the monopolies they have now 
0,it only serves to help feeding the doctors who get artificial monopoly with government controlled supply if you want more coverage  allow more medical schools and students instead of subsidizing their monopoly i guess aipac has it under total control with this liberal narrative though
0,if medicaid expansion had been mandatory as in the original law  i think obamacare would be doing a much better job  however complying with the regulations made the private insurance market pretty brutal as far as sticker shock goes the new normal is a highdeductible plan  which incurs a lot more out of pocket lump payouts trying to meet that deductible if you  have health insurance  with a  3000 deductible  you can still easily go bankrupt when that bill hits  if not immediately then somewhere along the journey to your  10000 out of pocket maximum for the year  i have a middleclass job but the only way i could pay for the outofpocket expenses to treat my wife s cancer was borrowing from my 401k  most people are nt so lucky  situations like this are just so unfuckingnecessary that it s incredibly frustrating if america ca nt figure out affordable universal healthcare like every other wealthy country  then america is nt that freaking great 
0,yeah my deductible for going to the er is insanely high so high i could nt pay it anyway so no insurance is the real life reality
0,i had high hopes for the aca  but it has not done anything for me all the plans are either too expensive for me or have very high deductibles i m all for single payer everyone puts in and everyone gets covered seems simple to me 
0,gt  our current medicare which covers the elderly is more efficient a much lower percentage goes for administrative costs leaving more money to spend directly on health care  this lie has been  debunked   http  wwwforbescomsitestheapothecary20110630themythofmedicareslowadministrativecosts  75e149515338   repeatedly   http  wwwahipcoveragecom20140103mythvsfactadministrativecostsinmedicareprivatehealthplans

0,what about the criticism that his healthcare plan has a   3 trillion hole   http  fiscalfactcheckcrfborganalysisofthesanderssinglepayeroffsets  according to the center for a responsible federal budget 
0,how can one vote for a man who did nt receive his first paycheck until he was 40 years old 
0,correct however please explain how anything more passes republican house bernies plan is doa until redistricting  and that s only if dems can be bothered to vote in 2020  unlike 2010 
0,should nt that be the whole point of insurance  home insurance does nt pay your cable bill car insurance does nt fill up your gas tank 
0,in the 1960s just before the government got involved in health care the cost of full coverage health insurance would be 20 dollars a month after inflation today 
0, sanderscare would take employer coverage away from tens of millions of satisfied customers  destroy the health insurance business  good 
0,the real question with sanders s plan is whether he s just pandering to his base to fire them up and get them more implicated in his campaign or whether he truly believes in this fantasy that he s trying to sell currently a working universal healthcare system needs much stronger price control mechanisms than the ones outlined so far in his plan  it just so happens that those price control mechanisms are also things that would be wildly unpopular to american voters  even though they d result in a fairer  more efficient overall system in the end is he just leading people on for their own good  this type of cynicism would run contrary to the image of integrity and honesty that he s trying to project so i m not completely sure what to make of this theory

0,hillary delivers her hot button issues often repeated but with no details of how she could end racism or sexism she likes to talk about both 
0,electing obama did nt end racism  electing hillary wo nt end sexism  and electing bernie wo nt end antisemitism  so how about we vote on platforms rather than which bathroom the candidate uses 
0,it d be nice if the article included some context 
0,so apparently hillary clinton is going to end racism and sexism  that s what she s implying i think we can all see what s she s doing and how she s taking advantage of people it s really exploitative and toxic clinton does nt know how to not be a racist 
0,holy hell  that s some serious mental gymnastics 
0,ironically  proper wealth distribution and fixing income equality does wonders for racism and sexism 
0,gt  recently  hillary clinton  s most prominent surrogate  former president bill clinton  told a rally of her supporters that he still considered himself to be the first black president  and that the human genome showed  we are all mixraced people   wait  did this actually happen  if so  how did that get under the radar 
0, if we fixed this one thing  would it fix everything  no  so let s not do it   high fives goldman sachs lobbyist  hillary rodham clinton
0,no probably not however  it would weaken the current status quo which has continued to perpetuate racism and sexism 
0,would electing hillary end racism  sexism 
0,what the fuck is wrong with her  she is the most detached and oblivious person 
0,what the fuck kind of broken logic is that 
0,a candidate that says she is not a part of the problems in this country but the solution is telling us fixing the problems is a pipe dream 
0,if we discovered a way to make solar power 100  efficient  would that end racism  oh  i guess we should nt try then 
0,non sequitur misdirection logic  no 
0,animal cruelty would also persist after these financial institutions are broken up why does bernie hate kittens 
0,if we made hillary president tomorrow  would that end racism  would that end sexism 
0,no  it isnt designed to  but a more equal economy would help alleviate the worst effects of racism and sexism on minorities
0,it would end her donors  support 
0,would nt it be cool if breaking up the big banks actually did end racism and sexism that d be awesome 
0,no but it would stop too big to fail  banking

0,equally ridiculous  here s a 1970 law review article in which mcconnell argues for presidential dominion in the supreme court nomination process http  imgurcompbeveod
0,republicans have always battled with severe cases of selective amnesia 
0,either way the process will be dragged out until after the elections the gop have the votes in the senate to say no and would rather gamble in 2016 they at least had the decency to inform everyone of what exactly they re doing this time around 
0,disclaimer  i think obama should nominate someone  and the senate should hold confirmation hearings but this article does not accurately describe most republicans  statements on this issue  the vast majority of republican statements  although  notably  not the cruz one cited in the article  carefully phrase the issue as whether a nominee has been  nominated and confirmed  in the president s last year in office  although kennedy was confirmed in 1988  he was nominated by reagan at the end of 1987  so he does nt fall under this definition 
0,politics were so different back then people on both sides had to at least pretend to be reasonable  http  wwwnytimescom19871112usreagannominatesanthonykennedytosupremecourthtml  pagewanted  all
0,kennedy having been nominated in 1987 to fill a vacancy created in 1987 a vacancy extended due to the rejection of robert bork for purely ideological reasons  got ta suspect a lot of rs remember that their sc nominees since bork almost always get hassled and delayed but the dem nominees got free rides this time around  why should they let a judge on the court that ll put a liberal majority on the court  it s not dems are gon na just let a president cruz appoint a conservative to replace ginsburg  this has all been building up for years since the dems stopped robert bork 
0,i for one welcome the rise of the green tea party 
0,gt  yeah  i am telling people what they want to hear  people want jobs they want health care they want educational opportunities for their kids they want to deal with climate change they want the wealthiest people to pay their fair share of taxes yeah  that  s what i  m telling people and on every one of those issues  that is exactly what the american people want 
0,to be honest  if the bernie movement can bring as much change to the democratic party as the tea party brought to the gop  i will be happy hate their agenda  but they did drag the gop to the right and got their candidates elected 
0,i just love the fact that bernie is genuinely as frustrated as most people in america 
0,bill  you deregulated wall street and helped directly cause the great recession stfu and stop ruining your legacy 
0,oh boy  bill has lost his mind 
0,smart move by the bernster just respond as if bill clinton is a harmless rambling little man which is what he s becoming  at this point 
0,the tea party was bought openly this movement is nt bought openly  the money is against us openly  this is nt some fairy tale this is a referendum 
0,sometimes  a lot of times actually  i really genuinely think that bernie sanders is a truly honest man  a gifted man  one in a generation that s not to be taken lightly  i really do believe that in my heart of hearts listen to him absolutely shred bill clinton in no uncertain terms i like this man 
0,bill flubbed agin 
0,if he s as nuts as the tea party  why is hillary trying to pretend she shares the same platform 
0,close but no cigar bill
0,billy is so silly 
0,shots fired 
0,the difference between the tea party and feel the bern is that one of these groups can hold down a job 
0,it has been almost 40 years since the love canal  and this is still happening we need to make some changes to  politics as usual 
0,wow  what he says is so true and spot on  part of me would take it further and start demanding prosecution of the people in power that made or allowed this to happen 
0,send the military and the plumbers in rip that water system apart and replace it i know that will still take a while  but the city is in ruined condition major overhaul required
0,perhaps this is a reminder of what may happen when we expand government to do  everything   little considering that taxpayers do nt have enough money for  everything  i wonder what the city  county  and national governments associated with flint have spent on projects over the last 20 years that were less important than replacing lead pipes that bring water into people s homes  or understanding that the chemistry of drinking water is indeed important when lead pipes are still extant you can try to make this a democrat  republican  liberal  conservative issue  but it s really a demonstration of how government systems can go wrong when the servants of the people lose interest in their service  and the people lose sight of demanding government do basic things before it starts doing political things

0,nevada also sabotaged america s nuclear industry harry ried worked very hard to stall the yucca mtn nuclear waste depository for the past decade the result is that states heavily reliant on nuclear power  mostly in the south  get screwed as they have to pay more for waste storage  ultimately nevada is run by clarke co and voters there decided two things  that they did nt want tax money to go towards solar rebates and that they did nt want nuclear waste storage site way up in yucca mtn

0,so it s a couple of links deep in this article  but if you go into the american gaming association s voter information papers that they actually distributed to gaming workers  they gave trump a yellow  green is considered progaming  red was antigaming  the man currently owns a las vegas hotel and casino and they gave him the same gaming rating as bernie sanders and the only reason they gave sanders a yellow is because  information not available  what an absolute sham the trump name literally is a part of the vegas skyline and this organization is trying to make trump out to be wishywashy on gaming 
0,i love arguing politics with coworkers
0,gt  the group s voter guide would probably pass muster in the precitizens united days  says larry noble  a lawyer for campaign legal center and former general counsel for the federal election commission  so the article is saying that  citizens united  has very little to do with this ability to essentially endorse candidates  before  citizens united   there was nothing wrong with a corporation saying  hillary clinton hates puppies   because the law drew a line at  hillary clinton hates puppies and you should nt vote for her  i m not really sure that makes a huge difference 
0,i ve found it s best to not discuss politics at work  mostly because i m pretty well informed and most people that want to talk politics are nt or worse  they re willfully ignorant 
0,that  casino voter guide   http  bigassetshuffingtonpostcomnvcasinovoterguidepdf  is pure garbage here are some highlights   hillary is designated  opensupportive  of gaming  apparently for paying some recent  lukewarm lip service to casino moguls this is despite her opposition to casinos when she was first lady of arkansas  which is mentioned first in the guide    ben carson is designated  opensupportive   and ted cruz is designated  mixed   but they have the same views  that it s up to individual states whether to allow gambling   cruz apparently loses points for saying the government should nt subsidize casino owners   bernie sanders is designated  mixed   citing  no information available  i suppose they could nt be bothered to make a fiveminute phone call to his campaign before printing up these brochures   donald trump is designated as  mixed   apparently because his atlantic city casinos went bust  along with the rest of ac s local economy   it s mentioned that trump currently operates a hotel on the vegas strip  but no bonus points appear to have been awarded for this 
0,keep just these recent decisions in mind where justice scalia was a part of the 54 majority that could have different outcomes if he is replaced by a democrat president   in a 54 majority limits in mccutcheon v fec  the court invalidated the aggregate contribution limits that were first put in place by the federal election campaign act of 1971   in atamp  t mobility v concepcion  the 54 majority ruled that corporations can effectively mandate arbitration agreements that preclude consumers from bringing class actions to combat fraud and enforce their rights without access to an impartial judge and jury  and without the resources to go it alone in arbitration  people typically abandon their claims and corporate wrongdoers are never held accountable many states enacted consumer protection laws to curtail the pernicious practice of forced arbitration  but in concepcion the supreme court held that such laws are preempted by an old federal statute from 1925 called the federal arbitration act  faa    the 54 majority in michigan v epa overturned epa regulations safeguarding communities from toxic pollution by power plants that causes up to 11000 premature deaths each year essentially  the court  s decision places a premium on businesses  bottom lines over public health and limits the epa  s ability to regulate hazardous air pollutants over the objections of corporate interests   in ledbetter v goodyear tire and rubber co  the 54 court majority made it virtually impossible to bring a claim of longrunning sex or race discrimination in pay under title vii of the 1964 civil rights act  a decision later reversed by a congressional statute a woman had been paid less than her male peers for 20 years and the court stated she had no right to bring a lawsuit for equal pay because she failed to file suit within 180 days of the first discrimination  even though she had no way of learning about the discrimination until years later   in davis v fec  a 54 majority overturned the  millionaire  s amendment   congress  s effort to level the playing field in the political process and reduce the influence of wealth on elections by increasing the contribution limits to candidates facing selffunded opponents   in florence v board of chosen freeholders  the 54 court majority ruled that local officials can stripsearch anyone accused of any crime  even if there is no reason to suspect contraband or concealed weapons  and can not be sued for invasion of privacy   the 54 majority in shelby county v holder overturned a key section of the 1965 voting rights act  making it much harder to protect against discrimination in voting not only did the majority dismissively reject tens of thousands of pages of congressional findings supporting the coverage formula contained in section 4 of the nearlyunanimous 2006 reauthorization of the vra  but the opinion was noted for failing to provide any legal or constitutional rationale for its holding nothing in the text of the constitution was cited to justify the court  s novel decision to strike down the cornerstone of american civil rights law   the 54 majority in leegin creative leather products inc v psks inc overruled a 96yearold rule that had made vertical price fixing per se illegal under federal antitrust law overturning the almost century of antitrust law  the court decided that manufacturers and retailers could sometimes engage in pricefixing in dissent  justice breyer cited studies estimating that this change in law would cost consumers  300 billion a year in increased prices on everyday items   a 53 majority  since justice sotomayor recused herself  in american express co v italian colors restaurant ruled that a smallbusiness owner could not bring an antitrust lawsuit challenging a large corporation  s alleged abuse of its monopoly power  even though  it was claimed  it was that very monopoly power that allowed the corporation to force an agreement to arbitrate and not litigate all complaints against it the court upheld the use of forced arbitration clauses even if it made enforcing federal laws like the sherman act practically impossible in dissent  justice kagan explained that the court  s decision allows   t  he monopolist    to use its monopoly power to insist on a contract effectively depriving its victims of all legal recourse   the 54 majority in burwell v hobby lobby stores  inc decided that forprofit corporations can claim religious rights and can exempt themselves from federal laws requiring them to provide contraceptive coverage to employees the majority also rewrote the religious freedom restoration act  with potentially dangerous consequences for lgbt and other americans   in parents involved in community schools v seattle school district  the 54 court majority prohibited school districts from attempting voluntarily to promote school desegregation through student reassignment plans   in walmart v dukes  approximately one million female walmart employees tried to file a classaction lawsuit over claims of sex bias the 54 decision by the court made it nearly impossible for a class of workers to use for widespread corporate misbehavior that comes in the form of unwritten policies essentially  every worker has to bring their own individual claim  making walmart and other large companies realistically judgment proof to these types of claim   in two 54 decisions  solid waste agency of northern cook county v us army corps of engineers and rapanos v united states  the court effectively took many waterways outside the protection of the clean water act  even though pollution from these waterways can dirty the drinking water of 117 million americans as a result of the court  s decision  1500 major pollution investigations have been halted  and epa actions against water polluters have fallen by 50    in national federation of independent business v sebelius which upheld the patient protection and affordable care act under the taxing power of congress  a 54 majority on the court overturned 70 years of precedent dealing with the commerce clause prior to this case  the court had held that congress has the authority to regulate activities that have a substantial effect on interstate commerce in the area of economic activities   substantial effect  can be found based on the cumulative impact of the activity across the country for example  the supreme court held that congress could use its commerce clause authority to prohibit individuals from cultivating and possessing small amounts of marijuana for personal medicinal use because marijuana is bought and sold in interstate commerce the relationship between health care coverage and the national economy is even stronger and more readily apparent the court had also said that congress could use its commerce power to forbid hotels and restaurants from discriminating based on race  even though their conduct was refusing to engage in commercial activity under an unbroken line of precedents stretching back 70 years  congress has the power to regulate activities that  taken cumulatively  have a substantial effect on interstate commerce people not purchasing health insurance unquestionably has this effect this ruling  if a liberal justice is replaced with someone like scalia  could overturn vast amounts of social programs like medicare and worker protections  on the other hand  occasionally a justice like justice kennedy has sided with the liberal justices to produce 54 decisions that would be in danger if a republican wins the white house and a liberal justice dies or retires while they are in office   in obergefell v hodges  a 54 court majority ruled that the constitution protects the right of samesex couples to marry   a 54 majority in texas department of housing and community affairs v the inclusive communities project upheld the longstanding interpretation of the federal fair housing act to prohibit practices with unjustified discriminatory impact   in massachusetts v epa  a 54 court majority upheld the authority of the epa to regulate greenhouse gases   a 54 majority upheld voterpassed nonpartisan redistricting reform in arizona state legislature v arizona independent redistricting commission   in williamsyulee v the florida bar  a 54 majority upheld a ban on state judicial candidates directly soliciting campaign funds   in boumediene v bush  a 54 majority ruled that prisoners detained in guantanamo can file habeas corpus petitions to challenge their detention   a 54 majority in alabama democratic conference v alabama invalidated a state redistricting scheme that used race to harm minority voters   a 54 majority ruled in favor of workers  rights in csx transportation v mcbride ruling railroads are liable for workers  injuries under federal statute if the railroad was partially responsible for the injury through its negligence

0,the  revolution  is real it s a rejection of globalist neoconservatism  being  policeman of the world   supporting us global hegemony at all costs i have bad news for bernie supporters  the revolution also rejects the agenda of the  globalist left  as well  through overwhelming public support for shutting down illegal immigration and curtailing legal immigration as well for years and years  the globalist left s political strategy has been to import thirdworld voters who support their agenda and do everything in their power to make sure they vote  reject voterid laws  bus people to polls  advocate compulsory voting  and even complain about how nebulous  oppression  causes disenfranchisement rather than pure apathy and lack of agency

0,i mean cmon ppl its 2016
0,well sanders  the predominant areas are all in cities controlled by one party and controlled by that same party for decades it is a real shame but it never came to light until they could try and pin it on a republican during an election cycle
0,and they knew  all the way up to the federal epa for months without telling people they were drinking poisoned water they took this time to argue over who s fault it was rather than to come up with a fix  this is nt a failure or one city or one state  it is a failure of government 
0,he s meeting with them now and he did nt know  has nt this been going on for a while 
0,got it hillary goes to flint  to see the people and condemms the situation vote grabbing just trying to get the checkoff for minorities and articles calling her out saying it was for other reasons sanders goes to flint  because he s a great man and condemms the situation  goodness out of his own heart and ttly not related to his political aspirations 
0,think how much  and of importance  will be  how much of flint  michigan s future has already been washed away with poisoned water a generation of young people whose potential has been capped by a lead ceiling they will struggle against for the rest of their lives are we not already engaged in a civil war  of which this is but one of many similar conflicts  this is not peace people at peace do not kill and maim each other with poison

0,i do nt like the  think about the children   line how about we re poisoning everyone in the region 
0,i am surprised that none of the billionaires in this country have thought to give back to an american city in need  the american people would love anyone who could do that public universities and private foundations could compete for the prestige of making flint great again 
0,gt  mr sanders said that he didn  t want to be  overly political  but that he had called for the resignation of gov rick snyder of michigan   if the local government can not protect those children  if the state government can not protect those children  then the federal government better   he said  oh really  well you just politicized it dipshit um is nt this a utility and a failure of local government  the federal government would do the exact same thing as the governor and delegate responsibility locally what party was running the city  nevermind i already know the answer  fuck you bernie you re so full of shit

0,this is confirmed by  this graph   http  pollingreuterscom  polltr131  of a very informative running poll he s closing the gap among  blacks   http  pollingreuterscom  polltr131filterssc_race  2  very quickly too  a 2540  change over one month  one troubling conclusion from this particular data set for the sanders campaign is that he is gaining almost all of his support from previous nonvoters rather than from converted hillary supporters  particularly in the general population   the early registration deadlines in many states will prevent a large chunk of sanders  momentum from translating to actual votes  since his new supporters will be unable to register up to a month before the primary  for example  in texas  previously unregistered voters activated by his results in iowa  new hampshire and the considerable media attention he s received since then will not be able to vote for him the cumulative effect of this over all states might decide the entire primary election 
0,interesting piece of data from this poll  gt  while sanders has drawn a significant portion of his support from the youngest voting bloc  under the age of 30   just 25 percent of millennial black voters said they are supporting the vermont senator  compared with 64 percent who said they are backing clinton the reverse is true among white millennials  who support sanders 75 percent to 22 percent  this does nt really conform with the media narrative i wonder if there are other polls with similar results 
0,i m sure this has been posted before but has anyone seen this  a bunch of really conservative people have posted this on facebook today and i m worried it is going to hurt bernie in the polls if anyone reads this is there any truth to it  also i m voting for bernie regardless but i just wanted to hear what others had to say  http  wwwthegatewaypunditcom201602berniesandersabumwhodidntearnhisfirstpaycheckuntilage40  mtcid  cf
0,and today s poll has clinton up 21 points in sc national polls do nt really mean much right now it s great he s more widely known nationally but he s done if he does nt perform well in the south 
0,the mother of all cherrypicked polls 
0,national polls do nt matter if he ca nt close the gap with minorities  unfortunately 
0,unfortunately  he s about to get crushed in south carolina  http  projectsfivethirtyeightcomelection2016primaryforecastsouthcarolinademocratic
0,bernie sanders and the whitehouse  if you think the two do nt go together  you re not alone but you re also wrong  not that he would hold that against you because sanders  with apologies to the democrats  barack obama  is perhaps the nicest and most sincere man in politics and has been for 40 years  walk through congress with sanders before the gates open and you ll see him greet the security guards and ushers by name sit near the podium during fillibusters and you ll hear him call out to the lobbyists watch him afterward and you ll find him standing patiently by his locker  respectfully answering the lamest questions from reporters representing the smallest hometown newspapers  that was nt something you would see with hillary clinton  clinton would question your parentage  sanders will ask about your kids  then listen intently to the answer  when the supreme court held a memorial service for justice scalia  sanders flew to texas to see his family  then flew right back to take part in the service never mind that it was his only day off in a month  it s just respect   sanders said  yet a politician who shows respect to everyone does nt always see it in return  clearly sanders lacks the glitz and glamour  the flamboyance and the egotism to stand out in a tabloid world which is why he s thought of primarily as a nice guy and not a great politician  truth is  he s both  he s also crew cuts and blue collars he s middle america  right down to the  please  and  thank you  in his world  guns are for hunting  not for carrying into night clubs  no wonder the license plate on his pickup truck  what else would he drive   once read dbth  shorthand for do nt believe the hype  but you can believe the numbers  which make a strong case that sanders should be the president  in this case  a nice guy should finish first 
0,how many articles do we have to post about him closing the gap  how about posting an article when he closes it 
0,no he s not he s not even close conservative news outlets said the same thing about romney in 2012 just to give false hope even going as far as saying he won the election stop posting sensationalized headlines from misleading sources  edit  the people down voting me because i m stating facts are just as bad as the audience at the last republican debate who booed the moderators for stating facts 
0,gt  trump holds the support of one in three evangelical voters  33 percent  oh  i get it now  those are the hard core evangelicals who want to hasten judgement day trump is their protest vote against this earthly planet
0,i think you really ought to have highlighted this paragraph  gt  while sanders has drawn a significant portion of his support from the youngest voting bloc  under the age of 30     just 25 percent of millennial black voters   said they are supporting the vermont senator  compared with 64 percent who said they are backing clinton   the reverse is true among white millennials  who support sanders 75 percent to 22 percent   sanders supporters are young  white liberals all this talk of  closing the gap  is going to be embarrassing in just a few weeks very similar to the way evangelicals thought the rapture was coming 
0,black voters know that sanders  goals  as good as they might sound  are politically unrealistic hillary is the better choice because at least she will raise the minimum wage to  12  which is more than most people make 
0,i might be going out on a limb here but maybe  just maaaaybe i am guessing that not many trump supporters are fond of obama so this will only be fuel for the donald to use in his next rally speech 
0,i think obama knows that there are a significant numbers of republicans that disagree with everything he says  and will thus continue to support trump  from the democrats  perspective  trump is the best gop candidate in the field because he is a wildcard and does nt follow the party line additionally  trump is not afraid to call out the gop s bullshit  even if trump does nt win the nomination  the longer he stays in  the more likely he is to damage the other candidates and the more likely he is to go 3rd party  obama plays chess the gop plays checkers 
0,this comment made by obama will only help trump because it elevated him above all the other opponents in south carolina obama basically recognized him as a front runner by making this statement 
0,what a great endorsement for trump bush and now obama attacking him just cements him as antiestablishment 
0, who s the president of the united states    ronald reagan   hah  an actor  then who s the vice president  jerry lewis  
0,let s be honest  it s george w could do it  anyone can do it 
0,meanwhile hillary makes barking noises on camera 
0,there s nothing you can do about that lol
0,obama can be pretty savage 
0,funny considering between obama and trump  trump is the only one that has ever actually created a  serious job  or held one 
0,has obama ever even had a private sector job in his life 
0,why do pundits still say trump is nt  serious   trump clearly stands to benefit by winning  both in terms of his net assets and in terms of political power and prestige 
0,yep very serious you literally have to cry on camera to regain your failing support as president  obama just made trump the candidate probably will go up 5  in polls 10  nationally  thank you so much mr obama   yeah  i remember your campaign also mr obama  hope and change  marketing and selling but oh waityou also say that trump is just a great marketershow i dont understand mr obama  are you just a hypocrite  or a bit ignorant  or are you just being a political liar  i thank the sweet baby jesus obama just made trump the candidate because republicans dont like obama and many democrats also dont like obama blacks dont like obama  lol  now you bernie supporters just pray he keeps on kissing the bum of hillary 
0,i see what you did there barack  well played  well played 
0,has trump called him a stupid poopyhead yet 
0,it s pretty likely the gop will have trump as their candidate  and wwwfivethirtyeightcom have been saying so for a while  however  the dems should be peachy so long as they do nt have a farleft extremist as their candidate oh  wait

0,secretaries of state break up big banks 
0,to be fair al gore came to my town  that is in the netherlands  last year to speak they paid him   150k iirc  i did nt go  tickets were quite expensive but i was pretty shocked how much some people get paid for a less than two hour speech
0,since when does the secretary of state has to deal with breaking banks or not 
0,so we ve moved on to supposition articles now 
0,if he had clinton s resume and was nt trying to dismantle the banking system  absolutely it s not like she was the only person they paid to speak they had an entire speaker series featuring successful people from diverse backgrounds 
0,secretary of state is foreign policy  she was nt the damn secretary of treasury  holy hell the misinformation and bad thought processes
0,the secretary of state is being taken to task for notbreaking up domestic banks  this is officially the dumbest anticlinton thing on rpolitics this week 
0,absolutely you are out of your minds if you think bankers are nt going to want to hear the outgoing treasury secretary speak 
0,i am fairly certain that if bernie sanders had been treasury secretary  that he would have been courted for speeches to banking events no matter what type of policy he had 
0,if goldman sachs is run by  say  surly junior high kids or ted cruz  yeah  i would nt pay to hear from enemies  if  however  i wanted to get a perspective of someone who did  indeed  regulate my business and lower my profit margin  i would want hear from them i would want to know their unvarnished perspective as the winner  in order to alter my strategy this is because i m a grownup  this does nt have anything to do with hilary  just that the premise of the title assumes that fifth graders run the world which  granted  may be true 
0,no  a bank would nt want someone who s actively trying to stop them from profiting so handsomely speaking at their institution  because you know exactly what a bernie speech to goldman sachs would sound like 
0,this speaking program is not some big secret you can go  look at their website   http  wwwgoldmansachscomourthinkingtalksatgs  for lots of information the point  according to one redditor who worked at a big bank  is simply  getting famous people to draw potential clients   https  npredditcomrpoliticscomments45xcbkwhile_clinton_and_many_on_the_left_decryd00xb90  context  3   the speakers are famous people of all stripes  prominent athletes  scientists  retired military  entrepreneurs  russel simmons  dean kamen   the archbishop of canterbury  etc  there are some leftyoutsider people too such as amory lovins and linda hirshman  but in general not that many are politicians because not that famous 
0,not a fan of hilary and do nt believe she has any desire to be super tough against big moneycorporationsbanks or whatever  but her job as secretary of state had nothing to do with the economy 
0,gt  if this sounds strange  let s imagine a slightly different scenario suppose bernie sanders had spent four years in president obama s cabinet during which time he did everything he could to try to break up the big banks and have corporate criminals put behind bars does anyone believe goldman sachs would pay him  250000 to recount his experiences  yes 
0,yes hillary clinton completely failed in her capacity as secretary of the treasury jesus fucking christ guys  quit shoving this shit down my throat 
0,why do we need to break up the big banks  it s not like tesla and apple and amazon and all the big companies can bank at the neighborhood credit union if we orderly capital markets and a strong economy we have to have the big banks 
0,ridiculous and obtuse argument but does nt matter because fuck hillary      _    _  
0,so she was an awful sos because she did nt break up big banks 
0,this article is just the consistent  hillary takes money from big banks  argument  only reworded poorly and framed in a way that makes no sense
0,secretary of state has nothing to do with domestic financial institutions people in this thread are so dumb 
0,yes  well maybe not 250k since he wasnt first lady as well  but there would probably be a big interest in getting him as speaker too
0,why would you think bernie would do that  there s a huge difference between what a politician with no real power will say versus what one will actually do once he is in power 
0,you people are the worst get past her speaking circuit money talk about a more interesting nonissue like her terrible yellow coat 
0,gt  it s not just that the politician wants to act to curry the favor of the rich and powerful  more typically they identify with the interests of the rich and powerful so that they do nt even see themselves as compromising a principle  gt  when we actually see money being handed over to politicians from the wealthy  whether in the form of large speaking fees or a highpaying job  it is probably best to think of it as analogous to a valentine present no one loves their spouse or significant other because of a generous valentine gift  rather it is a symbol of ongoing affection 
0,self posts not allowed oh wait unless it s from a corporate entity it is
0,yes  they just want to throw money around for the fun of it have you not watch the wolf of wall street 
0,not the best analogy being in the cabinet does nt mean you just get to do whatever you want you d probably have to stay in your lane  how about   bernie sanders spent his 30year political career not just talking about income inequality and the necessity of government regulation on big banks  but acting on it does anyone believe goldman sachs would pay him  250000 to recount his experiences  
0,gt  suppose bernie sanders had spent four years in obama s cabinet and tried to break up the big banks does anyone believe goldman sachs would pay him  250000 to recount his experiences  except hillary did nt say that by all accounts given so far  it was more a rahrah speech than it was her telling goldman of her accounts of trying to break up the big banks so this entire statement is based on a false supposition 
0,i find it funny how almost every comment here is making fun of the stupidity of this post and article yet the article has 4000 points  87  liked  and is sitting at the top of reddit 
0,we ran out of everything else and now we re down to making up shit entirely eh 
0,the top comments in this thread are all people who only read the quote and not the entire article smh
0,wtf what a stupid argument clinton was sec state  not the sec treasury or head of any regulatory agency so she would nt be doing anything to threaten banks they likley had her speak bc she s a clinton  been around and former sec state  even if she was a regulator  it would nt surprise me if she would speak at a banking event  and any  breaking up of banks  would be bc congress came up with a law with regs requiring them to divest themselves of certain busiensses  ie reinstating glass  steagall provisions 
0,are you kidding  of course they would  why do you think it s the toughest most vicious prosecutorsregulators get hired by the banks  not only do poachers make the best gamekeepers  but it also takes them out of the equation if gs offered bernie a million to do some work for them it would make it much harder for him to come down on them later 
0,hillary is a status quo presidential candidate  if she gets the nomination and the job things will remain mostly as they are with little attempt to change them  the big banks know this 
0,just another way of saying what bernie said in the last debate   i m paraphrasing   i guess these banks just love to throw away money  right   it s obvious to anyone who will think about it  but plenty of people are invested in not thinking about it 
0,know thine enemy so yes they would he would most likely refuse it regardless if he was retired or not 
0,you mean  650k
0,i thing goldman sachs is double playing you all 250k is absolutely nothing to them but it is enough to appear to support hillary without really helping her this obviously actually hurts her and helps sanders  the one they really want in office because they can us him to suck the blood out of our economy and send us into depression  where sachs will profit massively 
0,exactly this  if i do not explicitly see it  it does nt exist  mantra is ridiculously short sighted i ve said the same thing before  probably on here   the politicians that do literally change their vote for cash  seem to be the ones that get caught the goal of the money is to bring these people into the same social strata as those with the money make them part of the club the more they hang out  the more washed over with those ideals they will be dishonesty is not a simple process 
0,ofcoursenothetalkstoslow 
0,sanders supporters  one problem is that some of us ca nt get on board with the evil wall street stuff it s very difficult legally to say exactly why and how you re going to prosecute bankers for what happened in 2008 it s very difficult to craft regulations to correct exactly the things we want without having either very bad unintended consequences  or loopholes that render them useless i see it as a problem we have as a country  and something we really need to think about and be smart about bernie actually kinda scares me with his us vs them stuff  if you have the time  take a look at  this video   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  qclmwlgcgg0  of a slightly boring economist who s studied the problem extensively to me this is kind of talk and approach we need if we really want to solve the problem sure  it s not a rousing as bernie s power to the people  stuff  but there you go let the republicans have their demagogues  someone needs to be the smart party 
0,i think it would be money well spent they can learn about his mindset and how to take evasive action for next time 
0,if he actually tried to break up the banks  getting a detailed debriefing of what worked  did nt work  and his thoughts on the matter   250k would be a bargain  think about it if you ran a company with billions in profit  and you spent millions on lobbying  paying think tanks  and other expensive tactics to prevent legislation and regulatory action against it spending  250k to find out from the other side what is actually working and not working would worth every penny 
0,does no one here remember anything that happened back when the clintons were still in arkansas  anyone that wants this person to be the leader of the   free world   has either had their head in the sand for the past 40 years  does nt pay attention to the history of this family  does nt care  or is probably under the age of 25 
0,that is so good  it should be in rshowerthoughts people are starting to wake up   
0,absofuckinglutely the correct question is do you think he d take it
0,if i were a wall street wolf  i would pay 250k for them to tell me how they tried to stop me  so i could learn more about how to defend my stake  and also because 250k is chump change 
0,every economist believes this is not going to do anything another big bank will just come up a few years after i think effective legislationlaws is a better action

0,fuckin hell  you all are embarrassing the bernie cult has to be comprised of nothing but college freshmen there s no other explanation rpolitics get your shit together  you fuckin idiots 
0,you did nt say it in your dream  carson you said it out loud on front of everyone you are awake this is the real life you were nt supposed to say it out loud 
0,this is such an obvious thing it almost has to go without saying if there was a republican president  the debate would ve gone like this   should president republican nominate a replacement justice   and then every candidate would ve said   of course  that s what the constitution says  if the democrats try to block the nomination they re clearly trying to impede democracy there s historical precedent of nominating justices  there s so much hypocrisy in modern politics it s disgusting at least admit that you only want obama to wait because he s not going to nominate a judge you agree with 
0,gt  carson said the supreme court has become a  political tool   adding that it might be time to look at term limits for the justices   when we enacted that program  the average age of death was 47 and now it  s 80 you know  things have changed  so we need to change with them   carson said  i m confused is ben carson making a well reasoned argument 
0,carson surprised me for once 
0,this precedent the gop speaks of  does not exist   http  wwwscotusblogcom201602supremecourtvacanciesinpresidentialelectionyears  
0,carson said something not crazy 
0,am i wrong or did they choose that photo as an homage to the kermit meme 
0,carson woke up just long enough to make a valid point but by the time the last word left his lips his eyes had returned to their familiar glazed appearance 
0,gt  then again  recognize that the two picks that the president has selected are ideologues  so there  s really no reason to believe that his next pick wouldn  t be an ideologue also  a  we d have to go back to anthony kennedy probably to find a supreme court nominee who was nt an ideologue  and even then  most were surprised kennedy s voting record turned out to be moderate  b  the president has nt picked yet therefore no one knows if this pick  who does not yet exist  is an ideologue  or not no one knows who it is  no one has had a chance to examine the person s record no one has had a chance to interview the person and to find out their thoughts and positions  basically  obama could pick someone so conservative that they make scalia seem like a bleedingheart liberal  and the republicans would still be opposed no on substance  but because its obama s pick they are opposed to everything obama does because obama did it they disagree with much of what obama does for substantive reasons  of course  but with all of it for the childish reason of trying to prevent obama from doing anything at all  even when they agree with him 
0,i respect him for being honest about this are we really expecting politicians to lie to us  that s terrible

0,i just want to say that this thumbnail is perfect 
0,does anyone else find it ironic that scalia would not agree with limiting terms of justices as carson throws out at the end 
0,i think most recognize he is allowed to nominate but the senate is still allowed to deny it
0,aw shit it must be the end times  because i agree with everything ben carson said in that article

0,i see they forgot to keep drugging his coffee 
0,of course is this really not common knowledge  do people really not realize it s an attempt to let a republican president nominate someone 
0, sips coffee  but thats none of my business 
0,he s entirely right  the only reason that republicans are complaining about obama being able to appoint a nominee for justice is because they fear that he ll pick someone that they do nt like  the republicans all agree that obama is  undermining the constitution   those are words taken straight from marco rubio s mouth   but when he has a  constitutional duty  to perform  they scream  he s gon na pick someone we do nt like  he should nt obey the law   hippocracy at its best

0,gt  hillary clinton  who fought to the left of barack obama in 2008 on topics such as health insurance  appears today as if she is defending the status quo  i felt obama was going to be more liberal than hillary  was i wrong to think that in 2008 
0,hillary s biggest foe in this election is google 
0,the hillary campaign is about hillary becoming president like she deserves it or something like us electing her is just completing some prophecy that hillary has waited her whole life to fulfill she reminds me of frank underwood in house of cards  the sanders campaign is not about giving sanders something  its about sanders giving the country something he doesnt act like we owe him something  he acts like we owe ourselves something 
0,the clinton s are using old scare tactics and smear campaigning from the 90s but with the birth of the internet and quickfact checking  the clintons have destroyed their own campaign more than anyone else has

0, her backers harp on her experience  but experience only counts if you learn from it  ouch 
0,did anyone else cringe a little bit when hillary named mandela as the foreign leader who would influence her foreign policy then hamhandedly segwayed into how she thinks bernie disrespects obama  it seemed like such a pander to the  mostly black  audience in south carolina that cost her the nomination there in 2008  i was happy that bernie forcefully defended himself there and told her he s supported obama throughout his term but  as a us senator  had a duty to the people to question the president in certain issues that s bernie s commitment to democracy over politics  something hillary does nt get 
0,i think her problem is that her understanding of how to do politics is quintessentially out of date she thinks you trade favors for progress she thinks you identify with people by feigning a common identity most damaging  imo  is that she still thinks of herself as part of an oppressed class all that seems corrupt and fake today 
0,let s dispel with this fiction that the clintons do nt know what they re doing they know exactly what they re doing 
0,nothing is more powerful than an idea whose time has come  this killed hillarys campaign in 2008 as democrats were euphoric over electing the first black president  and undecided  independent voters were leery of the clinton brand and the negatives that come with it  its 2016 wall street greed sucker punched the world to its knees in 2008 young voters are looking at a  still  broken health care system  staggering college loan debt  skyrocketing housing costs  stagnant wages in a time of record corporate profits and trillion dollar cash hoards  and hillary clinton  while repeatedly cashing enormous speaking engagement checks and donations from wall street and big healthcare  pharma  keeps attempting to tell voters that she is the change agent that will fix wall street and healthcare  bernie sanders is like a genie that popped out of the bottle at exactly the right moment in time  who appeals to all the voters put off by clinton for reasons i just mentioned

0,wanting to place an arbitrary limit on the size of financial institutions is one of the strangest ideas to gain mainstream acceptance in the field of economics  the problem is not that banks are too big  it s that they re too leveraged  given the networking effects involved in finance  having 10 overleveraged small banks may not be any better than having one big overleveraged bank it may actually be easier to regulate and monitor the big one

0,there is only one issue i have with what he said and perhaps some on who has a higher degree in economics than i do can explain why i m wrong  i have a minor in economics but does nt increased capital requirements mean banks have much less money to lend thus reducing the amount of money in existence  in economic terms anyway  and thus inflating the value of the dollar  since there is less of it in circulation  causing exports to weaken and imports to strengthen and if my understanding serves one of the problems of the recession was that bank credit simply dried up would nt this idea lead to a similar thing happening  also how small are we talking of making these banks  because economies of scale are still important to keep in mind when redistributing the banking system

0,gt  carson said the supreme court has become a  political tool   adding that it might be time to look at term limits for the justices   when we enacted that program  the average age of death was 47 and now it  s 80 you know  things have changed  so we need to change with them   carson said  i m confused is ben carson making a well reasoned argument

0,carson woke up just long enough to make a valid point but by the time the last word left his lips his eyes had returned to their familiar glazed appearance 
0,gt  then again  recognize that the two picks that the president has selected are ideologues  so there  s really no reason to believe that his next pick wouldn  t be an ideologue also  a  we d have to go back to anthony kennedy probably to find a supreme court nominee who was nt an ideologue  and even then  most were surprised kennedy s voting record turned out to be moderate  b  the president has nt picked yet therefore no one knows if this pick  who does not yet exist  is an ideologue  or not no one knows who it is  no one has had a chance to examine the person s record no one has had a chance to interview the person and to find out their thoughts and positions  basically  obama could pick someone so conservative that they make scalia seem like a bleedingheart liberal  and the republicans would still be opposed no on substance  but because its obama s pick they are opposed to everything obama does because obama did it they disagree with much of what obama does for substantive reasons  of course  but with all of it for the childish reason of trying to prevent obama from doing anything at all  even when they agree with him

0, sips coffee  but thats none of my business 
0,he s entirely right  the only reason that republicans are complaining about obama being able to appoint a nominee for justice is because they fear that he ll pick someone that they do nt like  the republicans all agree that obama is  undermining the constitution   those are words taken straight from marco rubio s mouth   but when he has a  constitutional duty  to perform  they scream  he s gon na pick someone we do nt like  he should nt obey the law   hippocracy at its best

0,well duh seriously  they just need to drop the act  we re going to block anyone obama picks because he s a democrat and we re republicans and we do nt want them gaining any more power it s politics  just say it we already know it  seriously  i would respect them more if they would quit pretending it has something to do with the american people choosing 
0,why is he still running  he obviously does nt care about his image in the party anymore 
0,no one actually cares  no republican  be they voter or legislator  gives a shit about whether there s precedent for stalling like this  and most of them are nt even pretending to does it prevent obama from achieving his agenda  then they re for it it s that simple

0,no shit the democrats know this the gop knows this obama knows this my 8 year old even knows this everyone knows this this wo nt stop the gop from being a bunch of obstructionist hypocrites  however 
0,the real question is  how did the reporter manage to get a full quote  every single reporter who has interviewed carson dozed off half way into the first sentence 
0,not only did he call the gop a bunch of hypocrites  but he also put forth an argument against the whole conservative ideology at the end lol 
0,wait did fucken ben carson have a moment of lucidity and logic  something grounded in reality and an analysis of the situation argued from logos instead of ethos  holy fucken shit

0,gt  clinton leads sanders 50 percent to 40 percent heading into south carolina  whose democratic voting electorate is more racially diverse than either iowa or new hampshire  sanders holds a narrow 3point advantage over clinton  47 percent to 44 percent  among white voters  gt  while sanders has drawn a significant portion of his support from the youngest voting bloc  under the age of 30   just 25 percent of millennial black voters said they are supporting the vermont senator  compared with 64 percent who said they are backing clinton the reverse is true among white millennials  who support sanders 75 percent to 22 percent  gt  the poll was conducted online from feb 814  surveying 11417 registered voters nationwide the survey s overall margin of error is plus or minus 11 percentage points  this  graph   http  media2snbcnewscomjnewscms2016_071418976nbcsurveymonkey_weekly_election_tracking_poll_clinton_sanders_chartbuilder_adabea7e779bf0fd083d1d5d52364cffnbcnewsux28801000png  that i found  here   http  wwwnbcnewscompolitics2016electionclintonmaintainsnationalleadoversandersafternhlossn519076  shows the national poll  s and sanders slowly  but steadily climbing it also shows hillary s decline on a somewhat sharper slant  due to her own campaign implosions 
0,this is the 2nd national poll since nh that real clear politics refuses to put up 
0,ah yes  the daily  sanders is closing the gap  post 
0,i m glad he s closing the gap  but i would of thought the gap should be smaller given all the scandals surrounding clinton 
0,this is confirmed by  this graph   http  pollingreuterscom  polltr131  of a very informative running poll he s closing the gap among  blacks   http  pollingreuterscom  polltr131filterssc_race  2  very quickly too  a 2540  change over one month  one troubling conclusion from this particular data set for the sanders campaign is that he is gaining almost all of his support from previous nonvoters rather than from converted hillary supporters  particularly in the general population   the early registration deadlines in many states will prevent a large chunk of sanders  momentum from translating to actual votes  since his new supporters will be unable to register up to a month before the primary  for example  in texas  previously unregistered voters activated by his results in iowa  new hampshire and the considerable media attention he s received since then will not be able to vote for him the cumulative effect of this over all states might decide the entire primary election 
0,interesting piece of data from this poll  gt  while sanders has drawn a significant portion of his support from the youngest voting bloc  under the age of 30   just 25 percent of millennial black voters said they are supporting the vermont senator  compared with 64 percent who said they are backing clinton the reverse is true among white millennials  who support sanders 75 percent to 22 percent  this does nt really conform with the media narrative i wonder if there are other polls with similar results 
0,i m sure this has been posted before but has anyone seen this  a bunch of really conservative people have posted this on facebook today and i m worried it is going to hurt bernie in the polls if anyone reads this is there any truth to it  also i m voting for bernie regardless but i just wanted to hear what others had to say  http  wwwthegatewaypunditcom201602berniesandersabumwhodidntearnhisfirstpaycheckuntilage40  mtcid  cf

0,bernie sanders and the whitehouse  if you think the two do nt go together  you re not alone but you re also wrong  not that he would hold that against you because sanders  with apologies to the democrats  barack obama  is perhaps the nicest and most sincere man in politics and has been for 40 years  walk through congress with sanders before the gates open and you ll see him greet the security guards and ushers by name sit near the podium during fillibusters and you ll hear him call out to the lobbyists watch him afterward and you ll find him standing patiently by his locker  respectfully answering the lamest questions from reporters representing the smallest hometown newspapers  that was nt something you would see with hillary clinton  clinton would question your parentage  sanders will ask about your kids  then listen intently to the answer  when the supreme court held a memorial service for justice scalia  sanders flew to texas to see his family  then flew right back to take part in the service never mind that it was his only day off in a month  it s just respect   sanders said  yet a politician who shows respect to everyone does nt always see it in return  clearly sanders lacks the glitz and glamour  the flamboyance and the egotism to stand out in a tabloid world which is why he s thought of primarily as a nice guy and not a great politician  truth is  he s both  he s also crew cuts and blue collars he s middle america  right down to the  please  and  thank you  in his world  guns are for hunting  not for carrying into night clubs  no wonder the license plate on his pickup truck  what else would he drive   once read dbth  shorthand for do nt believe the hype  but you can believe the numbers  which make a strong case that sanders should be the president  in this case  a nice guy should finish first 
0,how many articles do we have to post about him closing the gap  how about posting an article when he closes it 
0,no he s not he s not even close conservative news outlets said the same thing about romney in 2012 just to give false hope even going as far as saying he won the election stop posting sensationalized headlines from misleading sources  edit  the people down voting me because i m stating facts are just as bad as the audience at the last republican debate who booed the moderators for stating facts 
0,gt  trump holds the support of one in three evangelical voters  33 percent  oh  i get it now  those are the hard core evangelicals who want to hasten judgement day trump is their protest vote against this earthly planet
0,i think you really ought to have highlighted this paragraph  gt  while sanders has drawn a significant portion of his support from the youngest voting bloc  under the age of 30     just 25 percent of millennial black voters   said they are supporting the vermont senator  compared with 64 percent who said they are backing clinton   the reverse is true among white millennials  who support sanders 75 percent to 22 percent   sanders supporters are young  white liberals all this talk of  closing the gap  is going to be embarrassing in just a few weeks very similar to the way evangelicals thought the rapture was coming 
0,black voters know that sanders  goals  as good as they might sound  are politically unrealistic hillary is the better choice because at least she will raise the minimum wage to  12  which is more than most people make 
0,hillary s biggest foe in this election is google 
0,the hillary campaign is about hillary becoming president like she deserves it or something like us electing her is just completing some prophecy that hillary has waited her whole life to fulfill she reminds me of frank underwood in house of cards  the sanders campaign is not about giving sanders something  its about sanders giving the country something he doesnt act like we owe him something  he acts like we owe ourselves something 
0,the clinton s are using old scare tactics and smear campaigning from the 90s but with the birth of the internet and quickfact checking  the clintons have destroyed their own campaign more than anyone else has

0,welcome to the information age  where your past words and exploits are but a click away and your facts and arguments that played so well to a captive audience  are disseminated and refuted within 24 hours and before they ve had their chance to sway voters 
0,sometimes i feel like candidates are running their campaigns like the marketing tactics of the early 2000 s are still effective on today s audiences not saying they are immune  but just like movie going audiences demand newer and more impressive things  consumers  especially younger  have grown up under a bombardment of the most sophisticated and fine tuned marketing the world has ever seen sometimes i do nt think most politicians this cycle have really kept up in bernie s case you have a good product but who knows  my state has nt seen it s primary yet so maybe i have nt got to experience the big guns 
0, her backers harp on her experience  but experience only counts if you learn from it  ouch 
0,did anyone else cringe a little bit when hillary named mandela as the foreign leader who would influence her foreign policy then hamhandedly segwayed into how she thinks bernie disrespects obama  it seemed like such a pander to the  mostly black  audience in south carolina that cost her the nomination there in 2008  i was happy that bernie forcefully defended himself there and told her he s supported obama throughout his term but  as a us senator  had a duty to the people to question the president in certain issues that s bernie s commitment to democracy over politics  something hillary does nt get 
0,i think her problem is that her understanding of how to do politics is quintessentially out of date she thinks you trade favors for progress she thinks you identify with people by feigning a common identity most damaging  imo  is that she still thinks of herself as part of an oppressed class all that seems corrupt and fake today 
0,let s dispel with this fiction that the clintons do nt know what they re doing they know exactly what they re doing 
0,nothing is more powerful than an idea whose time has come  this killed hillarys campaign in 2008 as democrats were euphoric over electing the first black president  and undecided  independent voters were leery of the clinton brand and the negatives that come with it  its 2016 wall street greed sucker punched the world to its knees in 2008 young voters are looking at a  still  broken health care system  staggering college loan debt  skyrocketing housing costs  stagnant wages in a time of record corporate profits and trillion dollar cash hoards  and hillary clinton  while repeatedly cashing enormous speaking engagement checks and donations from wall street and big healthcare  pharma  keeps attempting to tell voters that she is the change agent that will fix wall street and healthcare  bernie sanders is like a genie that popped out of the bottle at exactly the right moment in time  who appeals to all the voters put off by clinton for reasons i just mentioned

0, he advised the president to nominate someone who has  an almost identical resume and capabilities of justice scalia   funny  did nt hear shit like this when they installed uber conservative clarence thomas to replace uber liberal thurgood marshall 
0,i think it is pretty hilarious that this is being referred to as a  conservative seat  on the scotus that s not actually how that works 
0,yeahbut only because he thinks they should nt automatically reject a scalia clone  should obama nominate one 
0,he wo nt be the last to break ranks too many of them are vulnerable in the election to hold the supreme court hostage while they re trying to campaign it would be a talking point at every rally or debate they went to  and it s a damned near impossible position to defend as anything other than   i do nt like obama  so i m preventing the highest court in the land from operating properly 
0, if he puts forth someone that we think is in the mold of president obama  s vision for america  then we  ll use every device available to block that nomination   tillis said he advised the president to nominate someone who has  an almost identical resume and capabilities of justice scalia   wtf  that is just plain stupid  dude  your team lost the election

0,gop calling their own tactics obstructionist  what s the temperature in hell right now 
0,the gop is putting their heads on blocks here ideally they get obama to nominate someone moderate then slow play until after the election if the dem wins they ratify obama s nom in a lame duck session if the republican wins they table the whole thing and their guy gets a pick  by outright refusing they open the door to obama not nominating anyone  or nominating a dream liberal who they ca nt support either way they look like the aholes who refused point blank before they knew what the offer was obviously this will be decided by the election  which is a startlingly democratic idea   i know obama should get this pick  but he really does nt have any leverage here  it s a political reality  what they should have done is suggest a dream nominee of their own an idea obama  or any president  could nt support then it s a dirty political fight on both sides and congress can play some offense during election season their is no rule that says they ca nt suggest a nominee 
0,yes  obstruct the nominee let the nominee be another symbol of what republicans have brought to the table over the last 7 years the republican party is a national disgrace

0,overblown he s simply giving the logical answer  yeah  we ll listen to him we ll still veto him  but we ll listen first

0,really  either he s retiring or he s not up for reelection for a while 
0,it will be very interesting how this whole thing shakes out i saw an article about rand paul saying that obama has a conflict of interest in appointing a sc nominee since many of the cases the scotus will be reviewing are dealing with which powers the president does and does not have obama will pick someone who has similar views to himself  but it will be interesting to see what their thoughts on presidential powers is

0,its also just unwise if they block his pick long enough  he ll just make a recess appointment while they re on one of their many vacations boom  senate oversight bypassed its ugly  but they re playing ugly 
0,is this buzzfeed  wtf is this click bait shit 
0,i feel that a progressive party would be inclusive to conservatives who understand social living and liberals who can fathom rural living the gop and democratic party have spent too much time forcing a false choice  imho 
0, we would strongly prefer you nominate the ghost of antonin scalia 
0, we should consider who obama nominates  but if they are nt exactly who we want based of our political ideology  we will block it  sore fucking losers they need to come back to the real world and realize that moderation and compromise run a government

0,gt  debunked this assertion with data showing that fewer than 1 in 10 abortion providers are in majorityblack neighborhoods the black population is largely concentrated into fairly tight areas  and make up less than 12  of the us population it would be interesting to see what percentage of black people as a whole have an abortion clinic in their zip code  zip was what was used in this  study   vs white people  to be a majority black neighborhood there would have to be quite a few black people there since their usage means that black people made up of 50  or more of the neighborhood  it could be 49  black  48  hispanic and they would nt consider it  majority black

0,does anyone know if conservatives  particularly republicans in the south  have some kind of more subtle agenda  s  beneath the veneer of  prolife  and  limited government   attempts to impede women s access to care in 2016 is so absurd that i often wonder if the motivations are deeper than just ignorancesexismracism  religion  and political ideology the ultimate consequences of interfering with women s health rights are so obviously ass backwards and to the detriment of society it makes my head explode  it would nt surprise me if many of these bastard politicians view such actions as a long term investment in their criminal justice systems and keeping their prisons filled  among other sinister motives  do these states  by chance  happen to reap any federal benefits from rampant populations growth  i know many red states get heavy federal subsidies it feels like there s more to it than concern for the  sanctity of life   perhaps i underestimate racism in the south 
0,funny  the only time i have personally heard the claim that planned parenthood was a conspiracysecret genocide of black people was from a professor that focused on black studies and who was herself black i also got to know a student who looked up to said professor as a mentor they both shared some of the most backwards  fuckedup  blmesque stances i have ever seen  this is not a conservative or liberal issue it s a misinformation issue people either make shit up to get what they want or they never bother finding out what s true or false before spouting shit to get what they want all dishonest sides will pull the same trick they want to break you down into groups so you re easier to control you can put any spin on any issue if you do nt care about the truth  here we see someone making an issue black and white while pretending to want to stop the issue from being black and white it is insane we have reached the point we have in politics everyone is contradicting themselves constantly the truth is the last thing they consider  i think the congresswoman made good points  and a gray stance would not bait as many clicks  but she is feeding the fire in her own way it is hypocritical and exhausting to see every day 
0,i love how people can talk about ethnic minorities ignorantly like they do nt fucking understand what a pregnancy is and what it means to take it to term  i remember a few years ago  political camwhore cory booker tried to live on foodstamps to prove that they were really shitty to be on and did nt do a lot for people when half these politicians are forced to work endlessly for shit hours because they do nt have the money to take time off  pay for constant checkups  carry a growing mass on their belly  gain weight  cut out their vices  smoking  drinking   stave off nausea on a regular basis  and then sit on a hospital bed in pain for multiple hours until they re shitting and their asshole tears and a kid comes out  i ll value their opinion on this as much as the opinions of the women who see what their future and what their fetuses  possible futures could look like  they can also adopt all the kids that are brought to term then given away  too just to be consistent surely that s why most of them are in the top 10

0,i had a conversation with my father about this i was home a couple of month ago  he was watching fox news as normal  well  some of the blacklivesmatter stuff came up i pointed out that cops usually show up in poorer areas more and generally treat them worse he said  they are nt targetting black people  it is just more crime happens there so of course that is where cops are more prevalent  then like 20 minutes later  brain surgeon grainstorage came on saying that black communities were being targetted by planned parenthood to commit black genocide i pointed out that that they were not in those areas targetting black folk but they were in more poor areas because they have less access to proper health insurance and birth control my father vehemently believed that pp was very racist  i then pointed out that if pp was targetting blacks  why were nt the cops or vice versa  he started ranting about how he did nt want his money to go to poor people and that i did nt know what it was like in the world screamed at me like i was a child  i am a 30 year old man  i have travelled the world  i have a good job but nope  i do nt understand the world

0,if both sides of the abortion debate spent the money they spend fighting each other on ectogenesis research this entire argument would be over by now and both sides would get what they want  we d live in a society where a woman can remove an unwanted fetus and one where those unwanted fetuses do nt have to be destroyed when removed literally having your cake and eating it too  if you ever have donated to either side of the abortion debate please consider doing some research on ectogenesis and helping fund laboratories working on the technology  if we work at it we could all see a world where sexual intercourse and breeding become entirely disconnected from one another 
0,it is a simple fact that not only are abortion rates higher in countries where it is illegal  but also abortion related health complications and deaths for women increase dramatically in these places whatever your view on life  souls  zygotes being children or whatever it is a fact that making abortions safe and available reduce many immediate atrocious problems in society and the benefits clearly outweigh the cost 
0,we did nt want obama to approach this job as a cynic  by now he has earned it while most have gotten frustrated watching it  this has been his entire waking life for over 7 years i would like to hear his commentaries of the process once he no longer has to keep decorum  this likely wo nt change  no matter who gets in each and every presidential contender left has pissed off a large number of people within the gop trump  rubio  jeb  and cruz are just as likely to be labeled the antichrist as sanders and hillary

0,this is a consequence of changing how the senators are elected it used to be that the house of representatives  and to some extent it is still called this   called the  people s house  basically  the senators used to be appointed by the states  and that was changed in the early part of last century  which puts a different kind of pressure on the senators to be as partisan as the house has always been 
0,we ve almost become accustomed to how obstructionist both parties can be with us stuck in the middle if only there were third parties and better voting systems to more accurately represent us 
0,we have three branches in order to separate powers this is part of it people act like this is something new the legislative branch  republican  is going to fight to leverage power from the executive branch  democrat  by trying to get more conservatives into the judicial branch a democratcontrolled senate would do the same to a republican president if roles were flipped and rbg s spot became available 
0,i m probably going to be shouted down for this  but i have to say  it s not congress s job to enable the president s agenda it is rather the president s job to faithfully execute the laws congress passes  if it decides to pass any so  yes  they ve obstructed his goals in office  but that s their prerogative likewise  while you and i may dislike it  if congress decides to attempt to hamper his goals in whatever ways its powers allow it to  that s part of the checks and balances present in the constitution  there s no clause in there saying   but if congress  really  wo nt play ball and you  really  want to do something  ignore them and do it anyway  that being said  he is free to tell them they are assholes if he wishes  honestly  i m happy to see a relatively inactive congress the us code is long enough

0,what a ridiculous piece of agitprop how hard have republicans tried over the years to get one of these laughable scandals to stick  i d at least like to see some originality this time around remember when she was accused of murdering vince foster  then when the obvious lack of evidence became undeniable it simply became another part of the elaborate conspiracy what is more believable  that no plausible reason for indictment exists or hilary is some kind of cartoonish supervillain who acts with impunity and controls the free world from the shadows  if you believe the latter  please also explain why she would want to run for president since she obviously has everything figured out already 
0,man the ny post really has it in for hillary 
0,it s the post never trust the post i do nt even like hillary clinton  but if you guys are at the point where the new york post  a murdoch owned tabloid  is considered a legitimate news source on clinton then there is something seriously wrong with you guys they ve been publishing unsubstantiated hit pieces against her for over 20 years  they are nt exactly unbiased

0,berine supporter here just came in to say   ny post  lol 
0,lolor it might just mean that  despite a concerted effort for 30 years to connect her from everything from murder to drug running  these are nt real issues 
0,it  might  also be reasonable to conclude that her not having been indicted is a sign she has nt broken any laws  you know  if you re posting fox news and ny post articles in support of your cause  it might be time to evaluate your course 
0,uhh i have a great idea  let s get ken starr back and give him unlimited power and tons of money to investigate endlessly and if he takes long enough maybe she will get caught having sex with an intern and all the little trolls can say  see i told you so  we always knew she did something  we just had to wait long enough for her to actually do it  gotcha  she s not my first choice for president but if she s so damn good at getting away with all the stuff she s been accused of for 30 years  then maybe she d make a tough and crafty president  in her absence i would nominate the following paragons of virtue  bob livingston  tom delay denny hastert scooter libby newt gingrich irancontra etcetc  yo investigate this  shit happens on both sides of the aisle but since the day bill clinton announced his first run for president  the republicans have redefined the term  witch hunt  if they were half as obsessive about fixing things  we d all be living in the  real  america we all deserve
0,hillary clinton has never broken a law is that the kind of person you want for president

0,i ca nt pinpoint if but something looks different about herhttp  imgurcomkqgo1jr
0,maybe the author of this article could show an example of a crime worthy of indictment  and why hillary was nt prosecuted for it  seems to me there s ample political will to prosecute the clinton s for any wrongdoing from the right  so if there s sufficient evidence out there  why is nt it being acted upon  just reporting that other people say there s wrongdoing worthy of prosecution is nt  evidence  of anything other than what that person claimed if ken starr has evidence that a crime was committed twenty years ago  what s he been waiting for

0,eventually  absolutely but it s going to be a rocky road in the mean time as big  throws everything they have at him to discredit and make him look weak fixing the corruption in this country is nt going to be fast or easy and will take everyone biting the bullet for a while we need to pursue what is right instead of the almighty buck

0,so i m assuming he s going to nominate someone that the senate has already confirmed for another position  eg  judge sri srinivasan  etc   it s hard for the senate to say someone is nt qualified when they just recently confirmed that same person  unanimously   as they did with srinivasan 970 this also makes me think that it s  not  going to be attorney general loretta lynch  since her confirmation was more of a battle  edit   here is a list   https  enwikipediaorgwikilist_of_federal_judges_appointed_by_barack_obama  of federal judges obama has appointed so far during his presidency as you can see  several of them were unanimously confirmed by the senate 
0,it is a better choice for obama to nominate a moderate  sensible pick  if he goes out on a limb  republicans will find it easy to paint the nominee as a crazy activist leftist if it s someone like sri srinivasan or paul watford  that argument is undercut  and obama can hammer the republicans for obstructing someone so obviously qualified  who they have confirmed before  
0, obama says those who say he should leave the nomination to the next president are reading something into the constitution that just is nt there  edit  accidentally double pasted text

0,there is certainly an age gap going on here it seems as if the only retort that hillary supporters can muster is  young people are too naive to know that they should support clinton  this seems similar to their other arguments  eg  women who support bernie are not real feminists  men who support bernie are sexist  berniebros    considering the incredible skill that young people have in accessing good and relativelyunbiased information quickly using modern technology  the position that young people are naive or underinformed seems to fall flat considering older generations  reliance on outdated information media technologies for their information  media that is largely controlled by corporate clinton supporters  it may be that it is the older generation of voters who are both naive and underinformed  i d like to hear other people s thoughts on this

0,gt  sanders  support is more pronounced among young women especially one survey showed women voters under 35 preferred sanders by an almost 20point margin  while young men preferred him only by 4 points  so in fact  ms  steinem  not where all the boys are

0,it s especially humorous because it s only  older democratic women  are  supposed  to go blindly hillary s way  because it s time for a woman candidate to be elected  men seem to be strangely irrelevant no  it s just that voters can actually do whatever they feel like  amazingly and bernie sanders tells the truth and we like it and hillary s simply a skilled politician  although i realize most of you poor sap s ignore it anyway but enough of them  believe me  are listening intently  and are voting with their feet for bernie

0,if she did nt know her husband had a loose cannon by now  there s just no excuse 
0,the  mixed race  comment is odd but not completely out of line  notwithstanding the criticism of the random  democratic blogger  they quoted more damaging is probably his claim that hillary clinton is a  changemaker  who can get things done where president obama could not  for two primary reasons  1 anything that she can accomplish with an overwhelmingly republican congress will come at the expense of the voters she is courting in the democratic primary  2 it illustrates an undeserved smugness as well as disdain for president obama s accomplishments it also demonstrates that her attack on senator sanders for being insufficiently supportive of the president is disingenuous political theater 
0,gt  in response  aaron camp  a democratic blogger  wrote   for  mr clinton  to claim that we are all mixed race people    is dismissive of the serious problem of racism and racial inequality in this country  and  as a matter of fact  racist  valid point but i could nt care less what a  blogger  has to say

0,welp  we ve finally done it  reached the point where a republican politician behaving  normally  is so outside the norm  it s breaking news 
0,gop calling their own tactics obstructionist  what s the temperature in hell right now 
0,the gop is putting their heads on blocks here ideally they get obama to nominate someone moderate then slow play until after the election if the dem wins they ratify obama s nom in a lame duck session if the republican wins they table the whole thing and their guy gets a pick  by outright refusing they open the door to obama not nominating anyone  or nominating a dream liberal who they ca nt support either way they look like the aholes who refused point blank before they knew what the offer was obviously this will be decided by the election  which is a startlingly democratic idea   i know obama should get this pick  but he really does nt have any leverage here  it s a political reality  what they should have done is suggest a dream nominee of their own an idea obama  or any president  could nt support then it s a dirty political fight on both sides and congress can play some offense during election season their is no rule that says they ca nt suggest a nominee 
0,yes  obstruct the nominee let the nominee be another symbol of what republicans have brought to the table over the last 7 years the republican party is a national disgrace 
0, this is not a case of a republican being righteous   http  wwwnewsobservercomnewspoliticsgovernmentarticle60375981html 
0,how dare he use such an accurate and exact term 
0,gt  gop lawmaker willing to give us empty lip service 
0,is being obstructionist illegal 
0,how many more do we need  like 4 
0,evidently tillis does nt really understand that it still obstructionism saying you re going to use every device available to block a nomination unless obama picks someone in the mold of scalia or it s just typical gop doublespeak saying his party wo nt be obstructiveas long as they get what they want  assholes man 
0,overblown he s simply giving the logical answer  yeah  we ll listen to him we ll still veto him  but we ll listen first 
0,wow  i was nt expecting the senator to be tillis maybe he s cognizant that he ll probably have a strongly contested election in 2020  because i had him pegged as a bit extreme 
0,they voted for revolutionary change  they got a vetocracy 
0, and there  when i had fallen furthest from the mouth of the cave  when i thought all hope for my rescue had fallen away  there i saw a light a small  flickering light far in the distance it called to me  faintly  but in the echoes of my tomb it might as well have been an orchestra  here here there is hope 
0,really  either he s retiring or he s not up for reelection for a while 
0,it will be very interesting how this whole thing shakes out i saw an article about rand paul saying that obama has a conflict of interest in appointing a sc nominee since many of the cases the scotus will be reviewing are dealing with which powers the president does and does not have obama will pick someone who has similar views to himself  but it will be interesting to see what their thoughts on presidential powers is 
0,and what is this persons name so that we can honor him 
0,sounds more like message refinement than a break from the party 
0,somebody is about to get primaried
0,too many of them are vulnerable in the saturday night massacre 
0,please note tillis is not opposed to senate republicans blocking obama from appointing anyone to be the next supreme court justice tillis is against saying it out loud 
0,where is chuck schumer when you need him ca nt we just filibuster for  oh say  18 months 
0,the  r  s just need to find a guy who uses terms like  jiggery pokery  and  pure applesauce  in legal opinions on a regular basis 
0,it is funny watching a dying party desperately exercise what power they have even if it makes them look like fools and only hurts their cause  btw my comments are related to how childish and foolish the party has acted in the last 5 years or so not saying they are going anywhere long term but it is just crazyness 
0,its also just unwise if they block his pick long enough  he ll just make a recess appointment while they re on one of their many vacations boom  senate oversight bypassed its ugly  but they re playing ugly 
0,is this buzzfeed  wtf is this click bait shit 
0,i feel that a progressive party would be inclusive to conservatives who understand social living and liberals who can fathom rural living the gop and democratic party have spent too much time forcing a false choice  imho 
0, we would strongly prefer you nominate the ghost of antonin scalia 
0, we should consider who obama nominates  but if they are nt exactly who we want based of our political ideology  we will block it  sore fucking losers they need to come back to the real world and realize that moderation and compromise run a government 
0, reads title  wow a pragmatic sane republican  reads article   if he puts forth someone that we think is in the mold of president obama  s vision for america  then we  ll use every device available to block that nomination  annnnnnnnd he s back
0,when i grow up  i want to be a senator so i can fillibuster  obstruct  and delay others from doing their jobs for as long as possible 
0,so this is how it s going to be  endless posts about this  despite nothing actually happening yet 
0,great  now we just need to get 4 more with a conscience and we can get a justice passed 
0,a rare conservative who actually fears his voters will reign him in for not doing his job  must be a swing state con 
0,how could they do this to their own abuela 
0,if you re a nonwhite american voter in nevada or south carolina  would nt you be a little angry to be regarded as part of a firewall  by this lady 
0,as an asian american  i m always a bit envious of minorities like blacks and hispanics who actually get touched upon in political campaigns and who people  journalists  activists  seem to always care about  the only asian firewall you ll hear of in the news is in china and its the technical usage of the term firewall 
0,god the lack of good polls pisses me off  i have no idea how to feel about nevada 
0,hillary s firewall is getting berned 
0,is nt saying  blacks are my firewall  or  latinos are my firewall  a bit weird   why did she start using that  firewall  phrase  
0,uh other way around latinos are losing faith in hrc 
0,of course they are the reality is that the more latinos and blacks learn about sanders  the more likely they will vote for him the only hurdle for them is awareness sanders  policies will make their lives better  period clinton s policies will just be the same old dc bullshit would you choose a better life or a shit life 
0, oh  no  my abuela  
0,he was polling at like 35  among hispanics a few months ago with his recent surge i would nt be surprised if he was tied with her or even ahead now 
0,latinos are gravitating towards bernie sanders  the only candidate with a  wallfree  campaign  feel the bern

0,what are important issues to latino community besides immigration reform  that s only thing i hear about
0,but do nt you get it    they had their fun voting for the black guy and they have to come to heel 
0,wow that is really good
0,so now hillary wants a wall 
0,man  both her and trump expect mexicans to build walls for them 
0,why the fuck is everything a firewall these days  why did i never hear this term any other election cycle 
0,i m in las vegas and i m switching from republican to democrat today so i can vote bernie on the 20th my family is probably gon na disown me but fuckem 
0,the way we keep using this  firewall  phrase  it sounds like she uses the bodies of the impoverished minorities to protect her fortune very disturbing image when you think about it 
0,hillary won the popular vote 
0,heh strange how vox quotes  latino firewall  in the headline but not in the article and in no way makes any indication of whom they re quoting i do nt believe i ve ever heard clinton use the term  latino firewall  so as for now  that s just vox saying stupid shit for clicks which is par for course 
0,the only people using the term  firewall  are in the media  usually in a way that is negative towards hrc s campaign  and yet redditors jump on the  this is offensive  bandwagon lol  wtf 
0,yes  let s all vote for the old white career politician 
0,we did nt want obama to approach this job as a cynic  by now he has earned it while most have gotten frustrated watching it  this has been his entire waking life for over 7 years i would like to hear his commentaries of the process once he no longer has to keep decorum  this likely wo nt change  no matter who gets in each and every presidential contender left has pissed off a large number of people within the gop trump  rubio  jeb  and cruz are just as likely to be labeled the antichrist as sanders and hillary 
0,this makes me miss jon stewart s mitch mcconnell impression so much 
0,we ve become accustomed to a lot of things this government does 
0,gt   there will be no cooperation for the rest of the year   march  2010 senator and former republican presidential nominee john mccain after the affordable health care act passed 
0,congress term limits add them pls 
0,everyone hates the senate no matter who is in charge of it need term limits 
0,almost 
0,the republicans want the government to fail so that they can say the government is bad and inefficient  and they can sell off the pieces to private corporations 
0,wait what if seeing that congress refuses to work with our president he just says ok i am going to veto everything congress passes till i get my way 
0,did nt obama also take part in obstructing the approval of a bush scotus nominee 
0,everyone say it with me    elections have consequences 
0,i personally have completely become accustomed to it i expect them to obstruct just about every thing that touches the left half of the spectrum  and so far  they have 
0,what chaps my ass is mr obama did nt say this five years ago  when the pattern was already well established 
0, well  at least they re not filibustering to keep the other party s majority from voting   http  articleschicagotribunecom20060130news0601300193_1_filibusterjudgealitoconfirmation 
0,he should know what he s talking about  since he joined john kerry in 2006 to filibuster george w bush s nomination of samuel alito to the supreme court 
0,yea  you almost have go back 2 whole years when the dems were in charge and harry reid would not even allow gop amendments to be voted on 
0,yeah well welcome to a 2 party system
0,checks and balances something something
0,oh ya  lets just pretend the dems did nt do the exact same thing when bush was in office 
0,hah  says the guy who has  himself  filibustered a scotus appointment 
0,shit  the dems would do the same thing both parties have to go 
0,dragging ass is only going to hurt the republicans with moderates and undecideds in the general election 
0,man those checks and balances of power in the constitution are a real downer 
0,this is a consequence of changing how the senators are elected it used to be that the house of representatives  and to some extent it is still called this   called the  people s house  basically  the senators used to be appointed by the states  and that was changed in the early part of last century  which puts a different kind of pressure on the senators to be as partisan as the house has always been 
0,we ve almost become accustomed to how obstructionist both parties can be with us stuck in the middle if only there were third parties and better voting systems to more accurately represent us 
0,we have three branches in order to separate powers this is part of it people act like this is something new the legislative branch  republican  is going to fight to leverage power from the executive branch  democrat  by trying to get more conservatives into the judicial branch a democratcontrolled senate would do the same to a republican president if roles were flipped and rbg s spot became available 
0,i m probably going to be shouted down for this  but i have to say  it s not congress s job to enable the president s agenda it is rather the president s job to faithfully execute the laws congress passes  if it decides to pass any so  yes  they ve obstructed his goals in office  but that s their prerogative likewise  while you and i may dislike it  if congress decides to attempt to hamper his goals in whatever ways its powers allow it to  that s part of the checks and balances present in the constitution  there s no clause in there saying   but if congress  really  wo nt play ball and you  really  want to do something  ignore them and do it anyway  that being said  he is free to tell them they are assholes if he wishes  honestly  i m happy to see a relatively inactive congress the us code is long enough 
0,says the former obstructionist senator 
0,plenty of blame to go around both sides are dickheads we need a viable third party  preferably libertarian in nature

0,he is right he was part of the obstruction back when he was in the senate when the democrats tried to delay bush s nomination until the next president was elected same shit  different year 
0,it s a republic  not a democracy do nt like it  get 60 votes in the senate for your team if you want to ram processes down the throat of the opposition party

0,apparently  when bill clinton declared that  the era of big government is over   he failed to account for republicans regaining control of the executive branch 
0,that s the slowest expansion of government since eisenhower
0,let s clarify this headline  during bush  13  more people joined the government payroll under obama  it continued to grow  but only by 8   the obama years have more federal employees than the bush years the government did not get leaner  it simply got bigger slower 
0,i m a democrat but come on  that was largely a result of the 2008 crisis and a maximalist congress
0,small government 
0,thanks feeorg no better case for a third party in this country i was already voting no on the leftright 2016 
0,to be fair to obama  after all the bush govt bloating there was nt a lot let for him to do 
0,we should probably appoint a committee to carry out a study to examine just how much bureaucracy has increased oh  government  never change 
0,yea  the gop are such hypocrites 
0,that s good for bush right  government bureaucracy is good for our economy think of the new bureaucratic jobs that will become available when america s entire health care industry is absorbed by the federal government under president bernie sanders we are about to put george bush to shame as far as government growth is concerned 
0,and thus  the birth of the tea party 
0,to be clear  this link discusses the growth in the number of us bureaucratic employees  is the number of employees added to the government payroll the best metric for how big a government is  or even an adequate metric

0,thank allah for donald trump 
0,i do not like hillary clinton but this shit is so fucking weak she is not riding on the coattails of her family she is not from a political family she and bill formed a partnership without this marriage does bill clinton ever become president  i do nt believe so hillary is not bill s child she is her own person a person who has worked hard to get where she is now stop equating her with the bushies there is no clinton dynasty at least not yet

0,how close can the bush brothers be  they do nt even have the same accent 
0,did we just get punked by the british   
0,and in a country that threw off kings and queens and inherited nobility  they can both shove it 
0,do nt forget bernie s uncle  colonel 
0,this is nt the same thing bill and hillary are married i assume probably met doing something politically active  and they grew together and nurtured each other s careers it s not surprising that both of them would dedicate their lives to politics and potentially both reach the top  the bushes  on the other hand  are related by blood  not by common interest in that case it s more like a hereditary ruler  what the op means by  close family member 
0,let s be real  george washington would be sickened by this bullshit the man left office after two terms for a reason 
0,eli5  we specifically wrote into the system that a president ca nt serve more than two terms and that after those terms they re still ineligibleforlife for several nonpresidential positions  why is nt there anything about a single familybloodline being ineligible for at least a decent handful of generations after holding the office  it seems like the exact thing that would have been on the founders minds considering they were separating themselves from a country using a monarchy 
0,our government has basically been a twofamily system  not just a twoparty system it shows how undemocratic our democracy really is

0,but i thought kashkari was a goldmansachs shill s you can read his full remarks  here   https  wwwminneapolisfedorgnewsandeventspresidentsspeecheslessonsfromthecrisisendingtoobigtofail  gt  i believe we must begin this work now and give serious consideration to a range of options  including the following  breaking up large banks into smaller  less connected  less important entities  turning large banks into public utilities by forcing them to hold so much capital that they virtually can  t fail  with regulation akin to that of a nuclear power plant   taxing leverage throughout the financial system to reduce systemic risks wherever they lie 
0,pretty funny rpolitics is all over kashkari right now  but when he ran as a republican for governor of california back in 2014 he was labeled a shill and considered to be one of the worst men in california 
0,you know sanders campaign is having an effect on this country from top to bottom when headlines like this start popping up try and imagine seeing a headline like this back in 2006  it sounds ridiculous to even think about 
0,oh  so now we re listening to former goldman sachs employees and members of the fed  that s interesting 
0,wanting to place an arbitrary limit on the size of financial institutions is one of the strangest ideas to gain mainstream acceptance in the field of economics  the problem is not that banks are too big  it s that they re too leveraged  given the networking effects involved in finance  having 10 overleveraged small banks may not be any better than having one big overleveraged bank it may actually be easier to regulate and monitor the big one 
0,this is called damage control banks and the fed know reform is coming it s better to control your own fate than let others do it for you 
0,people forget that the federal reserve bank    is not    a government organization it is a privately owned institution it is  the  big bank 
0,he s wrong about  not seeing the next crisis   banks are still selling cdo s and we re due for another housing bubble it wo nt be as bad as the last one due to consumer confidence being low and inhibiting the unbridled optimism that fueled the last one rest assured that we can expect more of the same when the markets correct again
0,there is only one issue i have with what he said and perhaps some on who has a higher degree in economics than i do can explain why i m wrong  i have a minor in economics but does nt increased capital requirements mean banks have much less money to lend thus reducing the amount of money in existence  in economic terms anyway  and thus inflating the value of the dollar  since there is less of it in circulation  causing exports to weaken and imports to strengthen and if my understanding serves one of the problems of the recession was that bank credit simply dried up would nt this idea lead to a similar thing happening  also how small are we talking of making these banks  because economies of scale are still important to keep in mind when redistributing the banking system 
0,this is what they called nationalizing the banks usually we re very clear that we want the government to stay out of our personal finances 
0,he s just pandering nothing to see here
0,someone s feeling the bern
0,he ll either get bribed  assassinated  or threatened and  change  his mind 
0,he s a better politician than hillary  a ridiculous number of bernie supporters seem to love the guy and do nt realize how deep in bed with the financialbanking industry he is 
0,i wish there were journalists that would insist on answers like these pundits do 
0,bernie is trying to raise  1m today  from his campaign   today hillary clinton left the campaign trail and is in new york city hosting a fundraiser  raising a grotesque amount of money from a small number of rich people probably at least  500000 let  s double that for bernie before midnight tonight add your contribution today  if you like bernie you should donate

0,gt  bernie is a problem hillary can  t figure out how to solve  perhaps because he  s not the problem she is   damn  usa today tell us how you really feel   edit   kristen powers  the author of the article  was a member of the clinton organization near the beginning of her career she has since been firm in her support of universal health care and immigration reform  including a path to citizenship however  her stance on social policies are less obvious it s unclear who she supports it s only clear that she has a strong dislike for the clintons 
0,to me  hillary appears to be a government employee looking for the promotion she feels she earned  contrarily  bernie appears to me to be a civil servant seeking to serve a larger electorate  such perspectives will naturally guide campaigns 
0,most recently  hillary seems to be making her platform   i m just like bernie  but i can actually succeed   which feels increasingly desperate 
0,gt  the new york times reported that clinton  s flailing campaign is trying out a new line  that   sanders is a  onenote  candidate who is captive to an  obsession  with wall street and campaign spending   clinton is determined to prove that sanders is not ready for office  but that she is    if we broke up the big banks tomorrow   clinton asked a group of union members   would that end racism  would that end sexism  would that end discrimination against the lgbt community     so is hillary s main campaign platform  ending racism and sexism  i thought a campaign on ending corruption in government due to big money and handing back power to the american people would be a better idea  gt  just so we  re clear  sanders is an unserious pieinthesky candidate because he wants to rein in campaign spending and institute a health care system that is commonplace in europe clinton  on the other hand  will eradicate sexism and racism in america who  s the dreamer here  after all  clinton can  t even keep her own campaign surrogates  gloria steinem and madeleine albright  from taking sexist swipes at young female bernie supporters  yup  there s this weird argument that bernie s ideas are fantasy and can not happen   even though plenty of other countries have already done it   http  iimgurcomtwl5nkppng   they ll use lines like  usa is bigger and more diverse or congressional obstructionism will prevent any of bernie s policies from happening  as if hillary would fare better with that reasoning   gt  clinton  s attack is  not surprisingly  dishonest  i think most here will agree with this last statement 
0,back when hillary ran against obama  i remember thinking that she would make a better president than obama  but that she could never win a general election i do nt remember disliking her  even when she went a bit negative  this year it s a bit different i still believe she is absolutely incapable of winning a general election the republicans just hate her too much the base will come out to vote against her  even if they wo nt come out to support trump or cruz or whatever empty suit they nominate  but this year  i m finding myself really disliking clinton on so many counts  her platform simply wo nt solve our problems her motives are clearly all about hillary her rhetoric is so crafted to mislead she s attacking a guy who has refused to attack her back  hillary is pretending to steal bernie s issues  without having the decency to actually do so she offers weaker versions of his plans  but claims they are stronger and she uses cheap rhetorical tricks to obfuscate the differences between her plans and bernies it s not a battle of ideas for her it s just manipulation and taking advantage of the confusion she s deliberately causing  she s clearly taken too much money from too many special interests to ever be impartial  let alone tough on their industries  worst of all is her condescending tone when speaking to young people she refuses to acknowledge their problems  and does nt seem at all interested in actually courting them she does nt think their votes matter she s sure they ll stay home i would nt mind all this if her actual platform and agenda was going to improve their lives but it wo nt  because has no understanding of their problems  i just ca nt vote for hillary i just ca nt she s a bad  bad candidate she will be a terrible president  i might get out and vote against donald trump getting the nuclear codes  if it comes to that but i m praying bernie pulls off the upset 
0,hillary essentially wants to maintain the status quo  which is nt exactly a great campaign slogan when so many people are alienated by the current political system 
0,can we please have more substantive discussions on why bernie sanders  ideas are the best ideas  i tend to agree with him  but at this point we have pretty much saturated reddit with these posts link to econometric articles  or tax policy articles  etc 
0,how is this title allowed 
0,in a way  this is how government is supposed to work  she s going to change her stance to represent the will of the people in order to win the election  because the election system essentially demands that  what i m concerned with is which ideals politicians will pander to  when politicians say that they think pp will make partial birth abortions mandated for all people  i want to hate that politician and their voters  when politicians say that they think gay marriage should be legal  but they did nt think that before  of course i m going to be suspect of their opinion but i am glad that they changed their mind to that stance  and i m glad the voters put that pressure on 
0,till date no hillary supporter has been able to tell me what her agenda is and why she wants to be president

0, i m not a one issue candidate because we are not a one issue country  misses the mark money in politics is the issue how can you have an honest conversation about any other issue when special interest groups hold sway over the political system and people s interests  she s nibbling at the edges and bernie is going straight for the heart

0,really the clinton campaign  does nt  have the funds first  they spend 3040  on polling alone second  their base cost for their expansive campaign  salaries  daily promotionals  etc  is really high that s like another 30   now consider that something like 65  of their donors are already maxed outso there s no returning to the well there she has a cash flow problem  which is why she s starting to draw the superpac money into the race 
0,just some stuff about priorities usa action  1  the article identifies it as  hillary clinton s superpac  but that s not really that accurate they support clinton now  but they were setup as barack obama s  official  superpac for the 2012 election establishment gon na establish  2  superpacs do have to disclose donors   here s 2012 for obama   https  wwwopensecretsorgpacspacgave2php  cmte  c00495861amp  cycle  2012    here s 2016 for hillary   https  wwwopensecretsorgpacspacgave2php  cmte  c00495861amp  cycle  2016   big donors are mostly hollywood execs  soros gave a lot though he always does  then it s a pretty diverse mix  it s not like it says  goldman sachs  all the way down  however yeah it s fair to say  100000 donations aint coming from the middle class  not really trying to take a position  just wanted to share facts i thought pertinent

0,has anyone in the media called them out on this hypocrisy  first they said they were nt working with a superpac  a lie  they re coordinating with correct the record superpac  one of her at least 3 superpacs   secondly  they said the superpacs were to only help in the general election against the republicans and make a level playing field except now they re unleashed against bernie 
0,what are you doing  bill  
0,i support sanders and it s a valid comparison they are both grassroots movements driven by frustration with the party establishment which are trying to steer the party to a less watered down version of what it claims to support they both have a more raw presentation which ignores the unspoken rules of what is okay to talk about they obviously have differences but from the high level  they are similar 
0,in fairness  before the tea party was coopted by fox news and freedomworks  it actually did have a legitimate grassroots origin which was born of   some   of the similar frustrations that sander s supporters are expressing now in this way the origins are not entirely dissimilar  what   i   think is amusing is that bill clinton is trying to smear sanders by comparing his supporters to a  successful  movement much as people may hate to admit it  the tea party completely changed the political landscape  and not just in dc  so i think the message is clear  folks former president bill clinton is telling sanders supporters that they too can change the entire political landscape   billisaberniebro
0,i do nt think that denigrating sanders supporters will prove to be a winning move for the clintons if hillary s supporters had half the passion as they do her campaign probably would nt be so nervous  in reality  i see huge differences between the sanders movement and the tea party the tea party was manufactured by fox news and freedomworks to serve the establishment s purpose whereas the sanders movement is a true grassroots movement against politics as usual night and day difference 
0,gt  he added that the democratic party is experiencing a pull to the left similar to the extreme right pull exerted on the republican party by the tea party  the irony is that the dnc pulled hard to the right beginning with his second term if anything  i see this is a selfcorrection  in fairness  he never said that sanders supporters are like the tea party  but he did make allusions to that effect  and  before i am blasted  i m a sanders supporter 
0,i know its intended to be a jab  but the tea party has been very effective at getting their vocal minority into a number of local and state positions 
0,more and more  i wonder if bill is not looking forward to living in the white house again  especially if he does nt get to have the oval office  he s been doing his  open mouth  insert foot  routine for a few days now 
0,they say things like this because they are desperate to hold power attack  attack  attack desperate that is the clinton way it s disturbing that anyone would support this family people that desperate for power should never be allowed to have it i ve asked people to explain why they support hillary the answer  because republicans that s it bernie is simply a superior candidate in the face of that truth  you attack and hope something sticks may the entire clinton family fade to a footnote 
0,thanks for lumping me in with the sarah palinmichelle bachmannted cruz sycophants bill 
0,also had interesting words to say about obama in 2008  gt   a few years ago  this guy would have been carrying our bags 
0,i m surprised people are arguing with this  i would ve thought the similarities to the tea party were obvious if anything  bernie is turning out to be more successful than the tea partiers were  he is challenging the party establishment  claiming that they are not representing the interests of a big portion of their constituents  and calling for change their tactics are pretty much the same  only the issues are different 
0,solid move  if your intention is to fuck up at everything 
0,he s not wrong the tea party movement was pretty successful and put people in office 
0,bill clinton started us out on the proverbial road to ruin with his thirdway  republicanlite shit policies  and now his wife wants to finish the job no thanks 
0,fair comparison  bernie supporters are very grass roots  however  i would say they are the antitea party 
0,now now bill  i have nt seen a sanders supporter with  a factually contradictory sign that betrays their lack of understanding of the issues   https  wwwgooglecomsearch  q  keepgovernmentoutofmymedicareamp  biw  1390amp  bih  770amp  source  lnmsamp  tbm  ischamp  sa  xamp  sqi  2amp  ved  0ahukewixiyr12_zkahvesimkhbilacgq_auibigb 
0,he s not wrong just because his last name is clinton  guys  he s 100  right this is absolutely the left s tea party moment 
0,the clintons are berning down their own campaign 
0,the ironic thing is that the democratic party could benefit from having a radical  do this or be primaried  movement willing to push the party to the left and allow the moderates to say  i would pact with you but those crazy people would eat my liver   in parlamentary systems the comunistgreenleftlibertarian parties are the ones doing pushing so the democratic socialist and liberal parties remain honest  it is heartbreaking that the husband of a  progressive  sees the progresive wing of his own party as the enemy  since hillary and bernie  agree  on so many things it must be so hard for her 
0,good at least _someone_ seems to see what s happening  shape up or be fractured  dnc 
0,in a way  bernie supporters are like the tea party citizens who are fed up with status quo party politics organizing to elect individuals that will change their party the difference is ideology 
0,he s not wrong half the people on this subreddit list trump as their second choice for president 
0,this is just crazy  bernie fans are ideological purists  fighting against a democrat in name only  dino   and trying to purge the establishment from dc  the tea party are ideological purists  fighting against a republican in name only  rino   and trying to purge the establishment from dc  big difference 
0,let me say that i certainly hope so  the tea party has completely taken over control of the gop to such an extent that the party establishment can no longer dictate to them with absolute authority  let s also take a moment to remind everyone that the tea party during it s inception was made and built by ron paul and his supporters it was nt until later that the movement was hijacked by a torrent of koch money and became simply an outcry of  boo obama   seeing as bernie s army puts corrupting money at spot  1 as far as problems go that s one we likely wo nt see 
0,whatever anyone thinks of the tea party  it s a simple fact that they ve done a decent job wresting control of their party back from the entrenched corporate interests that were attempting to dominate it or at least they were  and even now there s a weird combination of uneasy alliance vs power struggle going on  if we can do the same on the left  i ll be very happy 
0,i mean  we are both interested in politics i guess 
0,he is correct  in that the fact the tea party was a republican cashroots campaign that took over and radicalized republicans and got them participating in government if this is somehow a bad thing for democrats to emulate then i missed the memo stating the government is a representation of corporate interests and not a representation of the peoples interests  edited for clarity 
0,damnit bill  i thought we were cool 
0,bill is gon na hand this election to bernie 
0,well then it would be wise for democrats to fall in line would nt it  the tea party cost several representatives their jobs and fractured the republican party beyond repair  of course the tea party is just a front for monied interests to cripple the federal government  but i think my point still kind of stands 
0,the clintons seems to think that it matter more that you get something done no matter what the consequences are than to be principled and not pass conservative legislation for the republicans 
0,i make a point to never take anything a serial rapist says seriously  nypd detectiveretired  
0,man  i used to like bill 
0,as a bernie supporter  there s some truth to that  the most rabid of us seem to not give a shit that they re using right wing attack fodder so long as it helps bernie all in the name of  fuck the system   the narrative is in fact being played by the system  it s disheartening really 
0,i compare clinton supporters to republicans like jeb 
0,theres no way thats going to turn voters off of hillary 
0,the tp was and still is a minority of the republican party progressives are damn near half of the democratic party the tp was and still is a group of know nothing bigots who were pissed an african american democrat was elected president their campaign was to take their country backfrom negros and to give every man  woman and child a gun progressives have real issues they stand behind that actually have a real impact on most americans  both financially and socially bill  if you treat us like the tp  we wo nt vote for you it gets worse though many others will be motivated to campaign actively against you you have made a grave mistake unfortunately  by the time your stuck in the 90 s campaign figures it out  it will be to late 
0,at least we do nt betray others 
0,they re literally doing the same shit as in 2008  like they thought obama must have been a fluke and it ll work this time obama was an approaching wave  and it s beginning to crest nothing will stop it  only slow it down  simply because time keeps on going forward and there s a whole generation or two that has more of it left on their side than the other generations do 
0,bill  why are you making me dislike you   why  i always liked bill clinton  thought he was a pretty good president how are comments like this supposed to make me feel 
0,nice try bill  maybe tomorrow s spitball claim will actually stick 
0,he is nt wrong bernie supporters often accuse her of not being a  true progressive   similar to how tea partiers primaried conservatives who they thought were rinos despite agreeing with them on most issues 
0,as far as i can tell they have nt been coopted by billionaires intent on fucking up america just yet 
0,bernie sanders supporters are increasingly becoming a liberal tea party a section of the democratic party unrelenting in its  extreme  principles  complete distrust of the current establishment  and a set of policy proposals which are outside the main stream of the democratic party  e  while bill clinton is trying to smear bernie sanders supporters i m not i just think he happens to be right whether that means sanders  unelectable  or if this is even a concern for his campaign remains to be seen 
0,it s the  third way  centrist obstructionists that impede progress they are those chanting  no we ca nt 
0,bernie sanders is no tea party insurrection 
0,we can both play this game  i suppose  bill clinton is a rapist  see  hurling shit at a wall until it sticks is fun 
0,this is what happens when you ca nt provide one simple  nonfluffy reason as to why you re running for president 
0,bill  you are making a fool of yourself 
0,as if i needed another reason to vote for anyone but hrc in the event bernie does nt win 
0,i did nt think it was possible  but i have less respect for bill with every detrimental comment he spews about bernie and his supporters he should realize he s going to need us if hillary somehow wins the nomination
0,go back to getting your dick sucked  bill
0,okay  bill clinton has jumped the fucking shark 
0,anybody who says  well i guess bills kind of right  the two movements are kind of similar in some respects  is missing the point  while bill is correct hes only trying to make a loaded point in an attempt to discredit the sanders campaign it s transparent rhetoric meant to create a negative association this is alarming because not only is it yet another black mark on clintons unethical campaign and persona  its just stupid politics it alienates voters and further divides a party that wants to win the general incompetence of this level does nt deserve to be rewarded in the internet age 
0,bill is shocked that progressives are trying to pull the democratic party back to the left after him and his third way democrats pulled it to the right  shocker 
0,bill  do yourself a favor  go ask your current intern for teabag 
0,ok  that s it  fuck this guy 
0,the matter being discussed is that teachers do not want to pay for the unions political activism  as they do nt want their money supporting the causes the union wants 
0,if the teachers union did a better job  then they would nt have to make the government force people to be members this means they have zero accountability to their members  which leads to the kind of teachers union waste and corruption we have here in chicago 
0,yeah those teacher unions are so great they are just awesome at making education better 
0,number 2 ranking democratic state senator will likely decide the race in georgia where hillary clinton is up by only 30
0,too bad he does nt carry a superdelegate vote 
0,ok guys  i love bernie but this is a random unscientific online poll that is about as meaningful as a poll of reddit users 
0,that reads like a proclinton push poll it did nt even ask about which candidate they d support  luckily it was nt a telephone survey  although pushpolling by telephone is also a thing  it s taking things pretty far  even for an unscientific survey  gt  1  sanders could be elected as president in november  as americans reject concerns over his identity as a  democratic socialist  okay  strong opening  gt  2  clinton is a betterqualified candidate because of her experience as the wife of a president  a senator and secretary of state  oh dear  if you were expecting a question here also regaling sanders  past career and marital status  you d be mistaken  gt  3  both candidates are actively vying for the votes of africanamericans those voters have better reasons to support  okay  without controlling for demographics  this does nt mean _anything_ gt  4  it is important to me that clinton be elected this year as the first woman president in us history  oh my 
0,i do nt know why clinton and her campaign believes that the south is going to be a safe haven for her  you see  the thing about southern democrats is that they share alot of thoughts and feelings with southern republicans that live all around them  every day  for their entire lives  if you keep on hearing and seeing people talk about how much they hate hillary clinton as southern democrats do when they re around southern republicans  some of that will eventually seep in 
0,gt  the atlanta democrat made his decision public just hours before sanders is set to speak at a morehouse college rally aimed at enticing black voters to give his campaign a second look fort  who is also considering a run for atlanta mayor    had endorsed clinton weeks ago    gt     after months of looking at bernie  s record and studying his positions   on healthcare  wall street  predatory lending and the minimum wage    i came to the conclusion that bernie  s position on the issues that affect my constituents in georgia the most conform most closely to my positions     said fort  really  it s all that it takes  compare and contrast hillary and bernie s record and platform the more people study bernie  the more likely they ll support him this is just one of many congressmen and women who will flip their endorsements 
0,i live in marietta i just called senator fort s office to say  thank you  for his support of senator sanders 
0,good for him  but why is it front page news that a state senator flips  are we that desperate for positive bernie news that we ll upvote even a minor thing like this and proclaim it as the beginning of the end

0,and so it begins 
0,i am i the only one who think that this is the opposite of the point i want people to support bernie because the majority of the democratic party members want to support him i do not want people flipping their support without counting a single vote in georgia

0,if you re open minded to the opinions of rightwingers  i suggest reading  this   http  wwwdailywirecomnews3280sandersandtrumparesametotalitariancandidatebenshapiro   its interesting 
0,they offer the same variation of the time tested outsider vs insider rhetoric that got every president elected since the early 90s  in 2008  it was hillary the beltway insider vs obama the political outsider  in 2000  george bush was the real american  down to earth folk that gets hardworking citizens  in 1992  bill clinton was the american dream he pulled himself from poverty up to the hallowed halls  and earned his way into yale law  now in 2016  we have two candidates who tapped into that same vein and using that rhetoric to get into power it is empty promises and platitudes that amount to nothing when they have to deal with people who disagree with them on a fundamental level 
0,i seriously do nt know how people voted for trump and believed he was the best guy for the job 
0, trump loves capitalism and the stuffed crust pizza it brings into our lives   http  iimgurcomn4pozfsgifv 
0,i legitimately ca nt decide which political move is more out of touch with reality  1 hillary boasting about having henry kissenger s support  2 jeb using george w on the campaign trail  it s madness it s absolute madness 
0,so this is just jeb s final hail mary move  right 
0,the other night trump was met which a chorus of boos for daring to challenge the conservative spin that  george w kept our country safe  trump pointed out that 911 occurred during the bush regime  despite warnings from the cia that this attack was imminent in a report titled   osama bin laden destined to strike in the united states  or something like that  trump also pointed out that bush s destabilizing influence is what created isis and emboldened terrorists in that destabilized region  which is also tantamount to not exactly keeping us safe  the howl of horrified boos from the audience was amazing  as though each of them was drinking the same koolaid
0,the really sad thing is that w looks like winston churchill compared to current crop of gop candidates
0,we need to dispel this notion that jeb bush knows what he s doing jeb bush has no fucking clue what he is doing 
0,jeb needs to get his mommy to help him campaign  and when that does nt work he calls in his brother who is nationally regarded as responsible for many of the problems we face as a country today  please clap 
0,jeb s mother told him to have george speak 
0,remember w was handed a surplus in 2001 and squandered it with incredibly irresponsible tax cuts during time of war the us is the only country in the history of the world to cut taxes during time of war conservatives have no standing to complain about the national debt because largely they caused it  now that we are in the paul ryan era  the budget deficit and national debt any more is absolutely intentional because they will use it to justify cuts in social security and medicare and anything else that does nt benefit the 1   it s the grover norquist method 
0,did you guys watch the speeches  i think it helped him people who do nt want anything to do with the bush family can snicker all they want  but it was definitely a plus for jeb bush has a 70  approval rating with republican voters it ll help with the nomination at least  w warmed up the crowd and jeb had a tough act to follow and it lit a flame jeb has never spoken with so much furor before it s a newer jeb  but probably too late to change much but  if jeb continues with the same confidence as yesterday he could climb to 2nd place rationally  in the very least it bought in the spotlight and people actually can hear about jeb s stance on things 
0,funny how the american media ca nt write stories like these but then  they would have to implicate themselves in absolute failure that was 43 s presidency 
0,i picture jeb  not wanting george to campain for him  but being to bashful to tell him 
0,you know it s bad when you re bringing in dubya to help out on the campaign trail 
0,it s also a reminder that the  burn it all down  mentality has its consequences people did protest votes against gore and the country has  in fact  burn to the ground in many respects a full  third  of our debt   66trillion  is from the bush tax cuts alone  and another 10    17trillion  is from the war in iraq we re looking at thousands dead and maimed servicemen and women and a foreign policy that has directly contributed to the rise of isis and islamic extremism in the middle east civil liberties have been rolled back with the usa patriot act  usa is part of the acronym   and bushappointed alito is practically trying to outcompete thomas for archconservative on the court  which gave us citizens united and nearly derailed the aca

0,i really think it s time for the us to have more political parties it s pretty obvious that both republicans and dems are sick and tired of their own parties we got a guy who calls himself a socialist and a real estate tycoon reality show star as front runners time for a reality check

0,obama looks at bush   it s not my fault  he roped me into it  bush looks at clinton   well he roped me into it  clinton plays his saxophonewearing a small badge that reads  first black president 
0,just to remind people what the george w bush presidency was really like  lie on top of lie  https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  yykc4gd2id4 also  the lehman brothers subprime mortgage scheme that drained  7t out of the us economy  sending the us into the great recession of 2008 was concocted early in the bush presidency  somebody will eventually write the true history and legacy of the bush family  from george hw bush to george w bush  and it will expose a family that very nearly destroyed the us 
0,i am not which president in my lifetime has a anything but a disastrous legacy even obama is nt going to be remembered fondly for some of the actions of the us during his presidency  if anything he seemed to double down on everything bush did wrong
0,i swear to god  barbara had to be smoking weed or eating lead paint chips while pregnant with those two w looks like he s got mange on the top of his head  and i love how laura just stands there next to him  without a clue  waving like a retard at everyone  she looks great by the way  regardless of what people try to say now  george w bush was one of the worst president s this country has ever had there s a mile long list of horrifically bad things his administration brought about  from 911 to the patriot act colin powell and rumsfeld were the only two competent people who came out of that administration  do nt forget  cheney created the nsa and the psychotic nsa contractor where the concept of ass raping and torturing innocent americans is somehow making us all safe 
0,7 years later  still blaming bush 
0,george w bush belongs in the hague  as do cheney and rumsfeld 
0,its his brother  its not surprising its like bill supporting hillary

0,one of the worst humans and presidents ever  what a total moron  thanks for destroying the lives of generations of americans 
0,umm  what does this have to do with how much hillary sucks and how awesome bernie is and how he s going to save america  stay on topic please

0,honestly shame on anyone who made fun of killer mike as an asset this man speaks truth to power better than sanders christ that was a great speech 
0,this article hits at my major reservation with clinton i do nt doubt her capability  i doubt her commitment to addressing of the concerns of my generation much of what young voters want is at odds with the clintonian  new democrats    third way  political triangulation 
0, in truth  our affluent  establishment democrats can no more be budged from their core dogmas  that education is the solution to all problems  that professionals deserve to lead  that the downfall of the working class is the inevitable price we pay for globalization  than creationists can be wooed away from the tenets of  intelligent design  
0,not bad for theguardian i like the last bit about the dogma of the left   education is the solution to all problems   not when preaching the wrong thing  edit  which was what the article was getting at  il admit i spedread
0,this  and another article  really describe to me the difference between clintonera thought and sanders thought clinton economics is to have unfettered capitalist coupled with biggovernment welfare in the form of transfer payments to those harmed by capitalism sanders favors a more fair form of capitalism that is restrained  designed to not allow people to become billionaires instead of transfer payments funded by taxes  he would rather see more opportunities with their cost baked into the pricing of goods and services  i prefer the sanders approach because it is tenable everyone hates high taxes to fund welfare payments it is better to put more people to work with an economy that is designed to do this rather than one designed to make a few people insanely rich 
0,if the democrats were against inequality  they would nt have given the shareholders of major financial corporations billions of dollars in free money over the past 8 years 
0,gt  that the downfall of the working class is the inevitable price we pay for globalization this is clinton s ethos so sorry  working class  but your suffering and futility is the price so that we can have our multinationals and cheap consumer shit but we all know  the elite are the real victims of globalization they get to see their fellow citizens suffer and die and it s the elite that has to deal with that burden 
0,so if republican establishment serves the 1  and democrat establishment serves the 10   1  inclusive   that leaves the 90  without any representation sounds like a cause for revolution to me it s just a republicrat money grab and some of you have been fooled to think it s different 
0,funny how truth is self evident wherever you find it

0,the aca is better than what we had before  but it s still far from a good system millions of people still have no access to health care because they ca nt afford the insurance premiums even people with decent insurance are going bankrupt because of deductibles  copays and expensive premiums the insurance industry does nt give a shit about our health it s time to get rid of the health insurance industry it should not exist it is just a parasite 
0,you know what is the current situation with healthcare in america   44 million people in this country do not have health insurance   33 million more are under insured   29 million adults fall into the medicaid coverage gap in which 89  are from the south 45  are white 41  are full time workers 26  are from texas  source   http  kfforghealthreformissuebriefthecoveragegapuninsuredpooradultsinstatesthatdonotexpandmedicaidanupdate  this is obamacare this is the aca  i think  and i believe many would agree  that hillary s  i m going to build on the aca  is really  i m going to make sure the health insurance industry remains a critical part of our healthcare system  whether or not medicare for all  single payer is  the  solution to our healthcare crisis  it is something worth pursuing throw out those who wish to keep the status quo

0,or worse  only a percentage of a catastrophic cost  mine only pays 80   20  of omgfuckingbullshitwtfnofuckingwayfuckthis is still bullshit 
0,it a better wold  all insurance would cover is unforeseeable  catastrophic costs the fact that you need insurance to pay for things that you know you are going to need  checkups  defeats the whole point of insurance 
0,insurance is supposed to only cover catastrophic costs  it s not supposed to cover your  20 subscriptions that s not what insurance is  that s one reason why prices are so high  imagine if your car insurance company had to pay for oil changesfluidsinspectionsetc the price would rise dramitically
0,currently in nc the only health insurance provider  blue cross and blue shield  for about 1015 eastern counties is going to cease to do business there  so people with preexisting conditions who were finally able to get insurance due to the aca are now being told they will have no coverage within their own county so their only recourse is to travel hours away from their own towns and buy insurance  then whenever they get sick to drive those same hours to see a doctor at all the aca was great for a lot of reasons but it is still very lacking and we need to move forward on true universal health care  not universal health insurance 
0,insurance is expensive 
0,well we could take down the healthcare monopolies and then allow for capitalism to way down the cost allowing for healthcare providers to compete statewide would help these two would see a cost reduction and open up insurance to people who may not be able to afford it now i does nt have to be universal health care to work  it just ca nt have the monopolies they have now 
0,it only serves to help feeding the doctors who get artificial monopoly with government controlled supply if you want more coverage  allow more medical schools and students instead of subsidizing their monopoly i guess aipac has it under total control with this liberal narrative though
0,if medicaid expansion had been mandatory as in the original law  i think obamacare would be doing a much better job  however complying with the regulations made the private insurance market pretty brutal as far as sticker shock goes the new normal is a highdeductible plan  which incurs a lot more out of pocket lump payouts trying to meet that deductible if you  have health insurance  with a  3000 deductible  you can still easily go bankrupt when that bill hits  if not immediately then somewhere along the journey to your  10000 out of pocket maximum for the year  i have a middleclass job but the only way i could pay for the outofpocket expenses to treat my wife s cancer was borrowing from my 401k  most people are nt so lucky  situations like this are just so unfuckingnecessary that it s incredibly frustrating if america ca nt figure out affordable universal healthcare like every other wealthy country  then america is nt that freaking great 
0,yeah my deductible for going to the er is insanely high so high i could nt pay it anyway so no insurance is the real life reality
0,i had high hopes for the aca  but it has not done anything for me all the plans are either too expensive for me or have very high deductibles i m all for single payer everyone puts in and everyone gets covered seems simple to me

0,should nt that be the whole point of insurance  home insurance does nt pay your cable bill car insurance does nt fill up your gas tank 
0,in the 1960s just before the government got involved in health care the cost of full coverage health insurance would be 20 dollars a month after inflation today 
0, sanderscare would take employer coverage away from tens of millions of satisfied customers  destroy the health insurance business  good 
0,the real question with sanders s plan is whether he s just pandering to his base to fire them up and get them more implicated in his campaign or whether he truly believes in this fantasy that he s trying to sell currently a working universal healthcare system needs much stronger price control mechanisms than the ones outlined so far in his plan  it just so happens that those price control mechanisms are also things that would be wildly unpopular to american voters  even though they d result in a fairer  more efficient overall system in the end is he just leading people on for their own good  this type of cynicism would run contrary to the image of integrity and honesty that he s trying to project so i m not completely sure what to make of this theory 
0,gt  trump not only pointed out that bush was president on 911 and that the attacks that day count toward his final grade  but he also noted that bush failed to heed intelligence warnings about the pending attack and that his administration lied to the public about weapons of mass destruction in iraq  all of which is common knowledge to the rest of us  but republican political orthodoxy forbids these things from being mentioned aloud trump is just being true to his distaste for political correctness

0,why do republicans continue to defend the failure that was the george w bush presidency
0,bush was president during 911 though 
0,i m pretty sure dick cheney was president on 911 
0,you know the gop  is doomed when fuckface von clownstick is making sense   actually we are all doomed

0,i hate that i am effectively defending bush  but there was a few hours worth of attacks on us soil during his presidency if that s the totality of the war waged against us during his term  there is an argument that he kept us fairly safe 
0,this thread is a disaster  
0,itt  but he s from france 
0,his bestseller really is nt a good book he gets historical facts wrong  uses very arbitrary  and bad  math  and the thesis has been refuted by many economists  and one grad student  
0, capital in the 21st century  is a book everybody should read 
0,if there s one thing the french are known for  its their economists  just look at that vibrant french economy 
0,the last economist that i would trust would be a french economist france is not only an economic basket case  it has made a total disaster with it muslim population 
0,id love to hear trumps reaction 
0,socialism is nice until you run out of other people s money 
0,notable how many economists are coming out in support of sanders 
0,and there are hundreds of economists who would disagree
0,of course a fucking frog would say something of this nature  just look at how great their socialist economy is doing  s
0,gt  french economist
0,one problem that will need to be addressed before even mr sanders  economic prescriptions can work  our currency is overloaded  in a computer program  if the programmer tries to do too many things with one variable  the result is sure failure humans overload their currencies in the same way and to the same result  they try to make their currencies do too many things at the same time a medium of exchange  a medium of wealth storage  a means of demonstrating success  etc this can be fixed by using specific currencies for specific things  a saving currency  a trading currency  an investment currency  etc make tax policies specific to the uses of the various currencies and to their conversions from one type to another this would require secure electronic currencies  on a related note  what is a good way to really screw up a government  hoard their currency or otherwise take it out of circulation  the us and other governments are experiencing this now as multinational corporations stash currencies in outofreach banks governments are foolish to allow these people  aka  corporations   to undermine their currencies in this manner

0, shows picture of sad child  this is why we need socialism screw your stupid papers and economists
0,agree 
0,of course he will  anything else wold be pointless  stupid and a waste of everyone s time  bu the republicans will still block whoever it is anyway  no matter how qualified they may be
0, me      republican heads explode    
0,as i posted on a different thread  i can not recall  or google  a supreme court candidate being nominated twice hence  if the senate is sincere about rejecting any and all nominees then whoever obama puts forward will be sacrificed it makes for an interesting decision in the white house  nominate the most appropriatedeserving and potentially lose them forever  or nominate a second tier candidate 
0,well  good it would be awful if you nominated someone who was nt qualified 
0,mfw obama nominates ted cruz 
0,   i intend to do my job today     potus  well that s good 
0,in b4 another jewish nominee
0,i think we need to dispel this notion that jeb bush does nt know what he s doing jeb bush okay  yeah  he has no fucking clue what he is doing 
0,try jebbushforpresidentcom lol
0,trump is savage buys the jeb bush website out from under him i hope he keeps the domain and isnt forced to give it back 
0,jeb just wanted a very classy  luxurious makeover for his site just the best the best 
0,also  rjebbush redirects to rthe_donald 
0,i just spat out part of my breakfast not a trump supporter  but that is fucking hilarious 
0,12 months a jeb 
0,jeb  is a foolish guac bowl merchant
0,rjebbush
0,actually  jeb never owned that domain a gay couple in oregon purchased it in 2013 or 14 
0,but but but my momma said i would make a great president 
0,chrome wo nt accept exclamation mark in the url how come 
0,savage donald  i literally own you  trump  ladies and gentlemen 
0,as someone who used to be responsible for a companies website  keeping domains and secure certificates current  you have to be really fucking stupid to let them expire not just because of what happened but you start getting reminders well before it expires  so to let it expire you purposely have to ignore it  or be so incompetent to assign your notifications to a nonmonitored email address you also have the option for automatic renewal if you ca nt be bothered to read your email plus you would think they would have paid for enough time to actually cover the campaign season 
0,troll level  pro
0,did nt this happen once before   
0,i do nt see how the two are related  the donald would buy  every  contenders name if they were available  that makes about as much sense as capitalising a url 
0,gleeful attempts to point out how unsuccessful the jeb bush campaign could well backfire in that this could in itself become an issue and soften opposition to both bush administrations and their respective presidents  best to ignore him rather that rub his face in the dirt 
0,jeb s website is jeb2016com
0,is nt cyber squatting a crime in the usa 
0,can we take a moment to discuss the picture in the article  i like bernie  but that image has a serious supervillanpracticinghisevillaugh vibe 
0,did nt some prohillary supporters  along with most media  say weeks ago  and for months on end  that even if bernie managed to win iowa and new hampshire that nevada would be his death knell because it had a large minority population and that bernie would nt be able to attract said minority voters  hmmm  oh now it s 80  white  great keep moving that goal post  gt  her staff repeatedly claimed that nevada was as white as the first two early states this was not only risibly false  but a clear sign that she wasn  t just lowering expectations but showing real fear she could lose nevada  february 20th ca nt come soon enough 
0,as a californian who just spent the weekend in nevada  you can tell her campaign there is getting desperate she has an ad in every tv commercial spot i d say the ratio of clinton to sanders ads were about 8  1 the one where she s  spent her life fighting for the childrens   i ve heard at least fifty times 
0,i m from nevada and me and my family are caucusing for bernie but i ve mostly been seeing hillary ads and ppl canvassing for hillary hopefully the turnout for saturday is more pro bernie
0,where can i find more nevada polls  rcp does nt have that many recent ones 
0, the clinton panic is palpable 
0,that thumbnail edit  not seeing it  disable subreddit style 
0,can confirm am nevadan voting sanders 
0,i will be really satisfied if the final presidential nominees are bernie sanders and donald trump because it means the system is nt completely broken and we re only offered the choices of gop or goplite 
0,well  bernie needs to win nevada or sc or else he s done for on super tuesday  so nevada is definitely his best chance 
0,i m in nevada and not registered as a democrat i was nt going to go because of this but saw a billboard for bernie here that says i can change the registration at the time of the caucus i m definitely going to go because of this and show my support fuck hilary 
0,i m a bit confused why should clinton be panicking about nevada   so far  all the polls are showing clinton in the lead by 10  or more   http  wwwrealclearpoliticscomepolls2016presidentnvnevada_democratic_presidential_caucus5337html  
0,maybe that s why the media is all but dismissing it it would mess up her whole diversity argument 
0,ralston is a moron i follow him pretty closely his reporting is great he always shows up and says what he sees  his analysis is yellow journalism garbage he wants page hits so he s going to spin this as a controversy when in reality he has no idea what is going on 
0,i do nt know why anyone ever claimed it was  considering how little polling was done in that state 
0,butbutsmug and condescending hillary supporters assured me that bernie could nt win in nevada  because nonwhite people 
0,bernie looks like he s about to ascend to heaven in that pic 
0,i m a big sanders supporter  but you got ta admit this was just clinton being smooth as fuck he sweettalked a curator and offered to pick up some litter so he could bring a date into an empty museum that is god damned romantic and in no way political 
0,somehow i thought this would be about them working in place of strikers  the usual meaning of  cross the picket line  which i did think was an odd choice for s first date for anyone curious here is the full quote  from hillary  around which the article is based ethical or not  your choice  i m just providing the quote for those who do nt feel like clicking  gt  we both had wanted to see a mark rothko exhibit at the yale art gallery but  because of a labor dispute  some of the university s buildings  including the museum  were closed as bill and i walked by  he decided he could get us in if we offered to pick up the litter that had accumulated in the gallery s courtyard watching him talk our way in was the first time i saw his persuasiveness in action we had the entire museum to ourselves we wandered through the galleries talking about rothko and twentiethcentury art i admit to being surprised at his interest in and knowledge of subjects that seemed  at first  unusual for a viking from arkansas we ended up in the museum s courtyard  where i sat in the large lap of henry moore s sculpture drape seated woman while we talked until dark 
0,scabs 
0,the actual story here is pretty neat and only solidifies my affection for bill
0,jesus fucking christ they were nt going in as scab workers bill lied about cleaning up the place to get in so he could have an evening alone with his lady this is like a scene from a shitty romantic comedy  not some insightful view into the clinton s neocon leanings for fucks sake can we concentrate on actual fucking issues and not try to convince each other that america s most prominent family of civil servants is evil because their names are nt bernie and sanders 
0,this is a cool story they did nothing wrong it was a creative way to see some interesting art and  in bill s case  a way to impress the girl you like 
0,so bill clinton  as a college kid  conned his way into a museum and had it all to themselves  but this is now a story about how bill and hillary were scabs  and therefore can now be construed to be secretly antilabor  this fucking sub has lost all sense of perspective 
0,just came here to say bill looks glorious in that photo 
0,the two top posts on rpoliticsrising   on bill and hillary clinton  s first date in 1971  they crossed a picket line   rodham and clinton were offering themselves as replacement labor  blunting  if only temporarily  the effects of the strike on the university   king  amazing archival video appears to show the arrest of a young bernie sanders as a student activist in chicago
0,wow this is hilariously over the top a sweet anecdote about their first date is spun into a tale of antilabor scabs totally totally ridiculous  this hillarybashing is really getting embarrassing for the hillaryhaters 
0,really mods  come the fuck on now 
0,i note that bernie sanders has   never   gone on a date with bill clinton 
0,this article reflects the rightwing conspiracy that started 45 years ago to thwart the first woman president from taking office 
0,once again people realize that clicking on an article takes too much work to decide how biased the headline actually is
0,i loathe the clintons with the power of a thousand fiery suns  but i sometimes really appreciate ol  slick willie something else  that s for sure 
0,they grow up so fast 
0,i was told to vote for this woman by my union  iam  but i voted for obama and i will vote for bernie this post leaves a really bad taste in my mouth what hypocrite s they are 
0,good for them  it s pretty amazing that people are upset that the clintons picked up litter that the people who were being paid to do so refused to do  it s like many people always say if they feel the compensation for the job is nt fair  quit and find a job that s more in line with what they feel they should be getting  if they ca nt find a job that pays what they think they are worth  perhaps they are overestimating the value of the skills they bring to the table  i m aware this article was submitted as an attack piece  but the story makes bill clinton look awesome 
0,this is in striking contrast to sanders who got arrested on his college campus for protesting segregation practices 
0,how is that a date   
0,i was taught at a young age  under 10  about not crossing a picket line  but i lived in las vegas with some decent unions would the clinton s have been taught that lesson before they were  20 raised elsewhere in the 60 s 
0,well they do nt have to do that anymore now they ll just get 600k for reading off a speech 
0,scabs  who d imagine that 
0, it is not acceptable to him  to me  or most americans  that 10  of the population of this nation is able to own 83  of its wealth  sheesh  he was on this issue well before everyone else was 
0,its amazing that most of what he said back then is still relevant now
0,i am not a jesse jackson fan i think he is a charlatan not because he s black because he s a charlatan 
0,wow i finally found something about bernie sanders that pisses me off touche 
0,1988 when white people had  run jesse run  bumper stickers on the front bumpers 
0,i happened to go to a jesse jackson stump speech that year he was a surprisingly good speaker  for real  maybe the best i have ever heard personally 
0,maybe jesse jackson should return the favor 
0,lol this is gon na make some heads explode does reddit love sanders more than it hates jesse jackson 
0,who did hillary endorse 
0,jesse jackson failed at two presidential campaigns unlike almost every other failed presidential candidate  however  he singlehandily made the democratic party what it is today 
0,i agree  blatantly hypocritical partybiased  leadership  is bad politics 
0,mcconnell did this because he s afraid of the gop base he knows exactly what limbaugh and beck would be saying if he had even feigned reasonableness the base would be up in arms if they thought for even a moment that the establishment would consider letting obama replace scalia he s stuck between a rock and a hard place 
0,it s bad politics  but unfortunately it s almost requisite in a destructive groupthink environment like the modern republican party if you do nt pretend to treat the talking points as gospel and reject compromise like a baptist rejects satan  you re rejected from the group when people make decisions based on fear of reprisal  they re being bullied those republicans who make blind pledges to block anything the president wants  they re being bullied by their own party  and they re caving to the pressure i do nt mean to say the victims of this bullying are nt in some ways complicit i m saying they re cowards 
0,i also do nt go to indian food restaurants because i do nt like the food i tried it a few times and no thank you  seems like the same theory here 
0,well after 7 years he is probably real familiar with barack s aka barry s selection patterns  after loretta lynch and sotomayor it is a no brainier to assume that barry will pick another loser
0,we are even i m shrugging off hillary 
0,this is what makes me think her supporters are so gullible she s playing them like a trumpet and they still defend her like she s the moral  pragmatic choice good luck 
0,well  to be fair  those fees are just a drop in the bucket when you consider the clintons  massive haul
0,does anyone believe that hilary clinton was not going to run for president 
0,let s talk about how secretary of state was too much for her and had her contemplating leaving politics multiple times 
0,staaahhhhhp
0,does nt this simply show that people are willing to pay a lot of money to hear hillary s views  and that wall street has a lot of respect for her global perspective  regardless of her policy proposals   i know it s easy to paint her as prowall street for this  but getting paid for a speech is far from lobbying for wall street or being  bought and paid for  anyone familiar with her platform would know that  i would be more skeptical if she spoke for free 
0,he was arrested for ignoring repeated attempts to explain himself to a judge that is something the marshal service does  he was not arrested for the student loan itself
